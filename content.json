FRANCISCONay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself. BARNARDO Long live the King! FRANCISCO Barnardo? BARNARDO He. FRANCISCOYou come most carefully upon your hour. BARNARDO‘Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco. FRANCISCOFor this relief much thanks. ‘Tis bitter cold,And I am sick at heart. BARNARDO Have you had quiet guard? FRANCISCO Not a mouse stirring. BARNARDO Well, good night.If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. [Enter Horatio and Marcellus.] FRANCISCOI think I hear them.–Stand ho! Who is there? HORATIO Friends to this ground. MARCELLUS And liegemen to the Dane. FRANCISCO Give you good night. MARCELLUSO farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relievedyou? FRANCISCOBarnardo hath my place. Give you good night.[Francisco exits.] MARCELLUS Holla, Barnardo. BARNARDO Say, what, is Horatio there? HORATIO A piece of him. BARNARDOWelcome, Horatio.–Welcome, good Marcellus. HORATIOWhat, has this thing appeared again tonight? BARNARDO I have seen nothing. MARCELLUSHoratio says ‘tis but our fantasyAnd will not let belief take hold of himTouching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.Therefore I have entreated him alongWith us to watch the minutes of this night,That, if again this apparition come,He may approve our eyes and speak to it. HORATIOTush, tush, ‘twill not appear. BARNARDO Sit down awhile,And let us once again assail your ears,That are so fortified against our story,What we have two nights seen. HORATIO Well, sit we down,And let us hear Barnardo speak of this. BARNARDO Last night of all,When yond same star that’s westward from the poleHad made his course t’ illume that part of heavenWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,The bell then beating one– [Enter Ghost.] MARCELLUSPeace, break thee off! Look where it comes again. BARNARDOIn the same figure like the King that’s dead. MARCELLUS, [to Horatio]Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio. BARNARDOLooks he not like the King? Mark it, Horatio. HORATIOMost like. It harrows me with fear and wonder. BARNARDOIt would be spoke to. MARCELLUS Speak to it, Horatio. HORATIOWhat art thou that usurp’st this time of night,Together with that fair and warlike formIn which the majesty of buried DenmarkDid sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee,speak. MARCELLUSIt is offended. BARNARDO See, it stalks away. HORATIOStay! speak! speak! I charge thee, speak![Ghost exits.] MARCELLUS ‘Tis gone and will not answer. BARNARDOHow now, Horatio, you tremble and look pale.Is not this something more than fantasy?What think you on ‘t? HORATIOBefore my God, I might not this believeWithout the sensible and true avouchOf mine own eyes. MARCELLUS Is it not like the King? HORATIO As thou art to thyself.Such was the very armor he had onWhen he the ambitious Norway combated.So frowned he once when, in an angry parle,He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.‘Tis strange. MARCELLUSThus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. HORATIOIn what particular thought to work I know not,But in the gross and scope of mine opinionThis bodes some strange eruption to our state. MARCELLUSGood now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,Why this same strict and most observant watchSo nightly toils the subject of the land,And why such daily cast of brazen cannonAnd foreign mart for implements of war,Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore taskDoes not divide the Sunday from the week.What might be toward that this sweaty hasteDoth make the night joint laborer with the day?Who is ‘t that can inform me? HORATIO That can I.At least the whisper goes so: our last king,Whose image even but now appeared to us,Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact,Well ratified by law and heraldry,Did forfeit, with his life, all those his landsWhich he stood seized of, to the conqueror.Against the which a moiety competentWas gaged by our king, which had returnedTo the inheritance of FortinbrasHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same comartAnd carriage of the article designed,His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,Of unimproved mettle hot and full,Hath in the skirts of Norway here and thereSharked up a list of lawless resolutesFor food and diet to some enterpriseThat hath a stomach in ‘t; which is no other(As it doth well appear unto our state)But to recover of us, by strong handAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid landsSo by his father lost. And this, I take it,Is the main motive of our preparations,The source of this our watch, and the chief headOf this posthaste and rummage in the land. BARNARDOI think it be no other but e’en so.Well may it sort that this portentous figureComes armed through our watch so like the kingThat was and is the question of these wars. HORATIOA mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.In the most high and palmy state of Rome,A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted deadDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands,Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.And even the like precurse of feared events,As harbingers preceding still the fatesAnd prologue to the omen coming on,Have heaven and Earth together demonstratedUnto our climatures and countrymen. [Enter Ghost.] But soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!I’ll cross it though it blast me.–Stay, illusion![It spreads his arms.]If thou hast any sound or use of voice,Speak to me.If there be any good thing to be doneThat may to thee do ease and grace to me,Speak to me.If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,Which happily foreknowing may avoid,O, speak!Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy lifeExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,Speak of it. [The cock crows.]Stay and speak!–Stop it, Marcellus. MARCELLUSShall I strike it with my partisan? HORATIO Do, if it will not stand. BARNARDO ‘Tis here. HORATIO ‘Tis here.[Ghost exits.] MARCELLUS ‘Tis gone.We do it wrong, being so majestical,To offer it the show of violence,For it is as the air, invulnerable,And our vain blows malicious mockery. BARNARDOIt was about to speak when the cock crew. HORATIOAnd then it started like a guilty thingUpon a fearful summons. I have heardThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throatAwake the god of day, and at his warning,Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,Th’ extravagant and erring spirit hiesTo his confine, and of the truth hereinThis present object made probation. MARCELLUSIt faded on the crowing of the cock.Some say that ever ‘gainst that season comesWherein our Savior’s birth is celebrated,This bird of dawning singeth all night long;And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,So hallowed and so gracious is that time. HORATIOSo have I heard and do in part believe it.But look, the morn in russet mantle cladWalks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.Break we our watch up, and by my adviceLet us impart what we have seen tonightUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.Do you consent we shall acquaint him with itAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty? MARCELLUSLet’s do ‘t, I pray, and I this morning knowWhere we shall find him most convenient.[They exit.] Scene 2[Flourish. Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude theQueen, the Council, as Polonius, and his son Laertes,Hamlet, with others, among them Voltemand andCornelius.] KINGThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s deathThe memory be green, and that it us befittedTo bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdomTo be contracted in one brow of woe,Yet so far hath discretion fought with natureThat we with wisest sorrow think on himTogether with remembrance of ourselves.Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,Th’ imperial jointress to this warlike state,Have we (as ‘twere with a defeated joy,With an auspicious and a dropping eye,With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,In equal scale weighing delight and dole)Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barredYour better wisdoms, which have freely goneWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.Now follows that you know. Young Fortinbras,Holding a weak supposal of our worthOr thinking by our late dear brother’s deathOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,He hath not failed to pester us with messageImporting the surrender of those landsLost by his father, with all bonds of law,To our most valiant brother–so much for him.Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.Thus much the business is: we have here writTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hearsOf this his nephew’s purpose, to suppressHis further gait herein, in that the levies,The lists, and full proportions are all madeOut of his subject; and we here dispatchYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,Giving to you no further personal powerTo business with the King more than the scopeOf these dilated articles allow.[Giving them a paper.]Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty. CORNELIUS&#x2F;VOLTEMANDIn that and all things will we show our duty. KINGWe doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.[Voltemand and Cornelius exit.]And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?You told us of some suit. What is ‘t, Laertes?You cannot speak of reason to the DaneAnd lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg,Laertes,That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?The head is not more native to the heart,The hand more instrumental to the mouth,Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.What wouldst thou have, Laertes? LAERTES My dread lord,Your leave and favor to return to France,From whence though willingly I came to DenmarkTo show my duty in your coronation,Yet now I must confess, that duty done,My thoughts and wishes bend again toward FranceAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. KINGHave you your father’s leave? What says Polonius? POLONIUSHath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leaveBy laborsome petition, and at lastUpon his will I sealed my hard consent.I do beseech you give him leave to go. KINGTake thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,And thy best graces spend it at thy will.–But now, my cousin Hamlet and my son– HAMLET, [aside]A little more than kin and less than kind. KINGHow is it that the clouds still hang on you? HAMLETNot so, my lord; I am too much in the sun. QUEENGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.Do not forever with thy vailed lidsSeek for thy noble father in the dust.Thou know’st ‘tis common; all that lives must die,Passing through nature to eternity. HAMLETAy, madam, it is common. QUEEN If it be,Why seems it so particular with thee? HAMLET“Seems,” madam? Nay, it is. I know not “seems.”‘Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,Nor customary suits of solemn black,Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,Nor the dejected havior of the visage,Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,That can denote me truly. These indeed “seem,”For they are actions that a man might play;But I have that within which passes show,These but the trappings and the suits of woe. KING‘Tis sweet and commendable in your nature,Hamlet,To give these mourning duties to your father.But you must know your father lost a father,That father lost, lost his, and the survivor boundIn filial obligation for some termTo do obsequious sorrow. But to perseverIn obstinate condolement is a courseOf impious stubbornness. ‘Tis unmanly grief.It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,An understanding simple and unschooled.For what we know must be and is as commonAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,Why should we in our peevish oppositionTake it to heart? Fie, ‘tis a fault to heaven,A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,To reason most absurd, whose common themeIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,From the first corse till he that died today,“This must be so.” We pray you, throw to earthThis unprevailing woe and think of usAs of a father; for let the world take note,You are the most immediate to our throne,And with no less nobility of loveThan that which dearest father bears his sonDo I impart toward you. For your intentIn going back to school in Wittenberg,It is most retrograde to our desire,And we beseech you, bend you to remainHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. QUEENLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.I pray thee, stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg. HAMLETI shall in all my best obey you, madam. KINGWhy, ‘tis a loving and a fair reply.Be as ourself in Denmark.–Madam, come.This gentle and unforced accord of HamletSits smiling to my heart, in grace whereofNo jocund health that Denmark drinks todayBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,And the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.[Flourish. All but Hamlet exit.] HAMLETO, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt,Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew,Or that the Everlasting had not fixedHis canon ‘gainst self-slaughter! O God, God,How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitableSeem to me all the uses of this world!Fie on ‘t, ah fie! ‘Tis an unweeded gardenThat grows to seed. Things rank and gross in naturePossess it merely. That it should come to this:But two months dead–nay, not so much, not two.So excellent a king, that was to thisHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my motherThat he might not beteem the winds of heavenVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and Earth,Must I remember? Why, she would hang on himAs if increase of appetite had grownBy what it fed on. And yet, within a month(Let me not think on ‘t; frailty, thy name is woman!),A little month, or ere those shoes were oldWith which she followed my poor father’s body,Like Niobe, all tears–why she, even she(O God, a beast that wants discourse of reasonWould have mourned longer!), married with myuncle,My father’s brother, but no more like my fatherThan I to Hercules. Within a month,Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tearsHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,She married. O, most wicked speed, to postWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!It is not, nor it cannot come to good.But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue. [Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo.] HORATIO Hail to your Lordship. HAMLET I am glad to see you well.Horatio–or I do forget myself! HORATIOThe same, my lord, and your poor servant ever. HAMLETSir, my good friend. I’ll change that name with you.And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?–Marcellus? MARCELLUS My good lord. HAMLETI am very glad to see you. [To Barnardo.] Goodeven, sir.–But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg? HORATIOA truant disposition, good my lord. HAMLETI would not hear your enemy say so,Nor shall you do my ear that violenceTo make it truster of your own reportAgainst yourself. I know you are no truant.But what is your affair in Elsinore?We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart. HORATIOMy lord, I came to see your father’s funeral. HAMLETI prithee, do not mock me, fellow student.I think it was to see my mother’s wedding. HORATIOIndeed, my lord, it followed hard upon. HAMLETThrift, thrift, Horatio. The funeral baked meatsDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.Would I had met my dearest foe in heavenOr ever I had seen that day, Horatio!My father–methinks I see my father. HORATIOWhere, my lord? HAMLET In my mind’s eye, Horatio. HORATIOI saw him once. He was a goodly king. HAMLETHe was a man. Take him for all in all,I shall not look upon his like again. HORATIOMy lord, I think I saw him yesternight. HAMLET Saw who? HORATIOMy lord, the King your father. HAMLET The King my father? HORATIOSeason your admiration for a whileWith an attent ear, till I may deliverUpon the witness of these gentlemenThis marvel to you. HAMLET For God’s love, let me hear! HORATIOTwo nights together had these gentlemen,Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,In the dead waste and middle of the night,Been thus encountered: a figure like your father,Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pie,Appears before them and with solemn marchGoes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walkedBy their oppressed and fear-surprised eyesWithin his truncheon’s length, whilst they, distilledAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to meIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,And I with them the third night kept the watch,Where, as they had delivered, both in time,Form of the thing (each word made true and good),The apparition comes. I knew your father;These hands are not more like. HAMLET But where was this? MARCELLUSMy lord, upon the platform where we watch. HAMLETDid you not speak to it? HORATIO My lord, I did,But answer made it none. Yet once methoughtIt lifted up its head and did addressItself to motion, like as it would speak;But even then the morning cock crew loud,And at the sound it shrunk in haste awayAnd vanished from our sight. HAMLET ‘Tis very strange. HORATIOAs I do live, my honored lord, ‘tis true.And we did think it writ down in our dutyTo let you know of it. HAMLET Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.Hold you the watch tonight? ALL We do, my lord. HAMLETArmed, say you? ALL Armed, my lord. HAMLET From top to toe? ALL My lord, from head to foot. HAMLET Then saw you not his face? HORATIOO, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up. HAMLET What, looked he frowningly? HORATIOA countenance more in sorrow than in anger. HAMLET Pale or red? HORATIONay, very pale. HAMLET And fixed his eyes upon you? HORATIOMost constantly. HAMLET I would I had been there. HORATIO It would have much amazed you. HAMLET Very like. Stayed it long? HORATIOWhile one with moderate haste might tell ahundred. BARNARDO&#x2F;MARCELLUS Longer, longer. HORATIONot when I saw ‘t. HAMLET His beard was grizzled, no? HORATIOIt was as I have seen it in his life,A sable silvered. HAMLET I will watch tonight.Perchance ‘twill walk again. HORATIO I warrant it will. HAMLETIf it assume my noble father’s person,I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gapeAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,If you have hitherto concealed this sight,Let it be tenable in your silence still;And whatsomever else shall hap tonight,Give it an understanding but no tongue.I will requite your loves. So fare you well.Upon the platform, ‘twixt eleven and twelve,I’ll visit you. ALL Our duty to your Honor. HAMLETYour loves, as mine to you. Farewell.[All but Hamlet exit.]My father’s spirit–in arms! All is not well.I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!Till then, sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’seyes.[He exits.] Scene 3[Enter Laertes and Ophelia, his sister.] LAERTESMy necessaries are embarked. Farewell.And, sister, as the winds give benefitAnd convey is assistant, do not sleep,But let me hear from you. OPHELIA Do you doubt that? LAERTESFor Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor,Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,A violet in the youth of primy nature,Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,The perfume and suppliance of a minute,No more. OPHELIA No more but so? LAERTES Think it no more.For nature, crescent, does not grow aloneIn thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,The inward service of the mind and soulGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirchThe virtue of his will; but you must fear,His greatness weighed, his will is not his own,For he himself is subject to his birth.He may not, as unvalued persons do,Carve for himself, for on his choice dependsThe safety and the health of this whole state.And therefore must his choice be circumscribedUnto the voice and yielding of that bodyWhereof he is the head. Then, if he says he lovesyou,It fits your wisdom so far to believe itAs he in his particular act and placeMay give his saying deed, which is no furtherThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.Then weigh what loss your honor may sustainIf with too credent ear you list his songsOr lose your heart or your chaste treasure openTo his unmastered importunity.Fear it, Ophelia; fear it, my dear sister,And keep you in the rear of your affection,Out of the shot and danger of desire.The chariest maid is prodigal enoughIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.Virtue itself ‘scapes not calumnious strokes.The canker galls the infants of the springToo oft before their buttons be disclosed,And, in the morn and liquid dew of youth,Contagious blastments are most imminent.Be wary, then; best safety lies in fear.Youth to itself rebels, though none else near. OPHELIAI shall the effect of this good lesson keepAs watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,Whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine,Himself the primrose path of dalliance treadsAnd recks not his own rede. LAERTES O, fear me not. [Enter Polonius.] I stay too long. But here my father comes.A double blessing is a double grace.Occasion smiles upon a second leave. POLONIUSYet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,And you are stayed for. There, my blessing withthee.And these few precepts in thy memoryLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,Nor any unproportioned thought his act.Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,But do not dull thy palm with entertainmentOf each new-hatched, unfledged courage. BewareOf entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,Bear ‘t that th’ opposed may beware of thee.Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,But not expressed in fancy (rich, not gaudy),For the apparel oft proclaims the man,And they in France of the best rank and stationAre of a most select and generous chief in that.Neither a borrower nor a lender be,For loan oft loses both itself and friend,And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.This above all: to thine own self be true,And it must follow, as the night the day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.Farewell. My blessing season this in thee. LAERTESMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord. POLONIUSThe time invests you. Go, your servants tend. LAERTESFarewell, Ophelia, and remember wellWhat I have said to you. OPHELIA ‘Tis in my memory locked,And you yourself shall keep the key of it. LAERTES Farewell. [Laertes exits.] POLONIUSWhat is ‘t, Ophelia, he hath said to you? OPHELIASo please you, something touching the LordHamlet. POLONIUS Marry, well bethought.‘Tis told me he hath very oft of lateGiven private time to you, and you yourselfHave of your audience been most free andbounteous.If it be so (as so ‘tis put on me,And that in way of caution), I must tell youYou do not understand yourself so clearlyAs it behooves my daughter and your honor.What is between you? Give me up the truth. OPHELIAHe hath, my lord, of late made many tendersOf his affection to me. POLONIUSAffection, puh! You speak like a green girlUnsifted in such perilous circumstance.Do you believe his “tenders,” as you call them? OPHELIAI do not know, my lord, what I should think. POLONIUSMarry, I will teach you. Think yourself a babyThat you have ta’en these tenders for true pay,Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,Running it thus) you’ll tender me a fool. OPHELIAMy lord, he hath importuned me with loveIn honorable fashion– POLONIUSAy, “fashion” you may call it. Go to, go to! OPHELIAAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,With almost all the holy vows of heaven. POLONIUSAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,When the blood burns, how prodigal the soulLends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,Giving more light than heat, extinct in bothEven in their promise as it is a-making,You must not take for fire. From this timeBe something scanter of your maiden presence.Set your entreatments at a higher rateThan a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet,Believe so much in him that he is young,And with a larger tether may he walkThan may be given you. In few, Ophelia,Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,Not of that dye which their investments show,But mere implorators of unholy suits,Breathing like sanctified and pious bawdsThe better to beguile. This is for all:I would not, in plain terms, from this time forthHave you so slander any moment leisureAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.Look to ‘t, I charge you. Come your ways. OPHELIA I shall obey, my lord.[They exit.] Scene 4[Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.] HAMLETThe air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. HORATIOIt is a nipping and an eager air. HAMLET What hour now? HORATIO I think it lacks of twelve. MARCELLUS No, it is struck. HORATIOIndeed, I heard it not. It then draws near the seasonWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.[A flourish of trumpets and two pieces goes off.]What does this mean, my lord? HAMLETThe King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,Keeps wassail, and the swagg’ring upspring reels;And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray outThe triumph of his pledge. HORATIO Is it a custom? HAMLET Ay, marry, is ‘t,But, to my mind, though I am native hereAnd to the manner born, it is a customMore honored in the breach than the observance.This heavy-headed revel east and westMakes us traduced and taxed of other nations.They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phraseSoil our addition. And, indeed, it takesFrom our achievements, though performed atheight,The pith and marrow of our attribute.So oft it chances in particular menThat for some vicious mole of nature in them,As in their birth (wherein they are not guilty,Since nature cannot choose his origin),By the o’ergrowth of some complexion(Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason),Or by some habit that too much o’erleavensThe form of plausive manners–that these men,Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,Being nature’s livery or fortune’s star,His virtues else, be they as pure as grace,As infinite as man may undergo,Shall in the general censure take corruptionFrom that particular fault. The dram of evilDoth all the noble substance of a doubtTo his own scandal. [Enter Ghost.] HORATIO Look, my lord, it comes. HAMLETAngels and ministers of grace, defend us!Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts fromhell,Be thy intents wicked or charitable,Thou com’st in such a questionable shapeThat I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee “Hamlet,”“King,” “Father,” “Royal Dane.” O, answer me!Let me not burst in ignorance, but tellWhy thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,Have burst their cerements; why the sepulcher,Wherein we saw thee quietly interred,Hath oped his ponderous and marble jawsTo cast thee up again. What may this meanThat thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,Making night hideous, and we fools of natureSo horridly to shake our dispositionWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?[Ghost beckons.] HORATIOIt beckons you to go away with itAs if it some impartment did desireTo you alone. MARCELLUS Look with what courteous actionIt waves you to a more removed ground.But do not go with it. HORATIO No, by no means. HAMLETIt will not speak. Then I will follow it. HORATIODo not, my lord. HAMLET Why, what should be the fear?I do not set my life at a pin’s fee.And for my soul, what can it do to that,Being a thing immortal as itself?It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it. HORATIOWhat if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord?Or to the dreadful summit of the cliffThat beetles o’er his base into the sea,And there assume some other horrible formWhich might deprive your sovereignty of reasonAnd draw you into madness? Think of it.The very place puts toys of desperation,Without more motive, into every brainThat looks so many fathoms to the seaAnd hears it roar beneath. HAMLETIt waves me still.–Go on, I’ll follow thee. MARCELLUSYou shall not go, my lord. [They hold back Hamlet.] HAMLET Hold off your hands. HORATIOBe ruled. You shall not go. HAMLET My fate cries outAnd makes each petty arture in this bodyAs hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me!I say, away!–Go on. I’ll follow thee.[Ghost and Hamlet exit.] HORATIOHe waxes desperate with imagination. MARCELLUSLet’s follow. ‘Tis not fit thus to obey him. HORATIOHave after. To what issue will this come? MARCELLUSSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark. HORATIOHeaven will direct it. MARCELLUS Nay, let’s follow him.[They exit.] ###Scene 5 [Enter Ghost and Hamlet.] HAMLETWhither wilt thou lead me? Speak. I’ll go nofurther. GHOSTMark me. HAMLET I will. GHOST My hour is almost comeWhen I to sulf’rous and tormenting flamesMust render up myself. HAMLET Alas, poor ghost! GHOSTPity me not, but lend thy serious hearingTo what I shall unfold. HAMLET Speak. I am bound to hear. GHOSTSo art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. HAMLET What? GHOST I am thy father’s spirit,Doomed for a certain term to walk the nightAnd for the day confined to fast in firesTill the foul crimes done in my days of natureAre burnt and purged away. But that I am forbidTo tell the secrets of my prison house,I could a tale unfold whose lightest wordWould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from theirspheres,Thy knotted and combined locks to part,And each particular hair to stand an end,Like quills upon the fearful porpentine.But this eternal blazon must not beTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O list!If thou didst ever thy dear father love– HAMLET O God! GHOSTRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder. HAMLET Murder? GHOSTMurder most foul, as in the best it is,But this most foul, strange, and unnatural. HAMLETHaste me to know ‘t, that I, with wings as swiftAs meditation or the thoughts of love,May sweep to my revenge. GHOST I find thee apt;And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weedThat roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.‘Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of DenmarkIs by a forged process of my deathRankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,The serpent that did sting thy father’s lifeNow wears his crown. HAMLET O, my prophetic soul! My uncle! GHOSTAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,With witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts–O wicked wit and gifts, that have the powerSo to seduce!–won to his shameful lustThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!From me, whose love was of that dignityThat it went hand in hand even with the vowI made to her in marriage, and to declineUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poorTo those of mine.But virtue, as it never will be moved,Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,So, lust, though to a radiant angel linked,Will sate itself in a celestial bedAnd prey on garbage.But soft, methinks I scent the morning air.Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,My custom always of the afternoon,Upon my secure hour thy uncle stoleWith juice of cursed hebona in a vialAnd in the porches of my ears did pourThe leprous distilment, whose effectHolds such an enmity with blood of manThat swift as quicksilver it courses throughThe natural gates and alleys of the body,And with a sudden vigor it doth possetAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,And a most instant tetter barked about,Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crustAll my smooth body.Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s handOf life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,Cut off, even in the blossoms of my sin,Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,No reck’ning made, but sent to my accountWith all my imperfections on my head.O horrible, O horrible, most horrible!If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.Let not the royal bed of Denmark beA couch for luxury and damned incest.But, howsomever thou pursues this act,Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contriveAgainst thy mother aught. Leave her to heavenAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodgeTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.The glowworm shows the matin to be nearAnd ‘gins to pale his uneffectual fire.Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me. [He exits.] HAMLETO all you host of heaven! O Earth! What else?And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart,And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seatIn this distracted globe. Remember thee?Yea, from the table of my memoryI’ll wipe away all trivial, fond records,All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,That youth and observation copied there,And thy commandment all alone shall liveWithin the book and volume of my brain,Unmixed with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!O most pernicious woman!O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!My tables–meet it is I set it downThat one may smile and smile and be a villain.At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.[He writes.]So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word.It is “adieu, adieu, remember me.”I have sworn ‘t. [Enter Horatio and Marcellus.] HORATIO My lord, my lord! MARCELLUS Lord Hamlet. HORATIO Heavens secure him! HAMLET So be it. MARCELLUS Illo, ho, ho, my lord! HAMLET Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come! MARCELLUSHow is ‘t, my noble lord? HORATIO What news, my lord? HAMLET O, wonderful! HORATIOGood my lord, tell it. HAMLET No, you will reveal it. HORATIONot I, my lord, by heaven. MARCELLUS Nor I, my lord. HAMLETHow say you, then? Would heart of man once thinkit?But you’ll be secret? HORATIO&#x2F;MARCELLUS Ay, by heaven, my lord. HAMLETThere’s never a villain dwelling in all DenmarkBut he’s an arrant knave. HORATIOThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the graveTo tell us this. HAMLET Why, right, you are in the right.And so, without more circumstance at all,I hold it fit that we shake hands and part,You, as your business and desire shall point you(For every man hath business and desire,Such as it is), and for my own poor part,I will go pray. HORATIOThese are but wild and whirling words, my lord. HAMLETI am sorry they offend you, heartily;Yes, faith, heartily. HORATIO There’s no offense, my lord. HAMLETYes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,And much offense, too. Touching this vision here,It is an honest ghost–that let me tell you.For your desire to know what is between us,O’ermaster ‘t as you may. And now, good friends,As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,Give me one poor request. HORATIO What is ‘t, my lord? We will. HAMLETNever make known what you have seen tonight. HORATIO&#x2F;MARCELLUS My lord, we will not. HAMLET Nay, but swear ‘t. HORATIO In faith, my lord, not I. MARCELLUS Nor I, my lord, in faith. HAMLETUpon my sword. MARCELLUS We have sworn, my lord, already. HAMLET Indeed, upon my sword, indeed. GHOST [cries under the stage] Swear. HAMLETHa, ha, boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there,truepenny?Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.Consent to swear. HORATIO Propose the oath, my lord. HAMLETNever to speak of this that you have seen,Swear by my sword. GHOST, [beneath] Swear. HAMLETHic et ubique? Then we’ll shift our ground.Come hither, gentlemen,And lay your hands again upon my sword.Swear by my swordNever to speak of this that you have heard. GHOST, [beneath] Swear by his sword. HAMLETWell said, old mole. Canst work i’ th’ earth so fast?–A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends. HORATIOO day and night, but this is wondrous strange. HAMLETAnd therefore as a stranger give it welcome.There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come.Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,How strange or odd some’er I bear myself(As I perchance hereafter shall think meetTo put an antic disposition on)That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,With arms encumbered thus, or this headshake,Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,As “Well, well, we know,” or “We could an if wewould,”Or “If we list to speak,” or “There be an if theymight,”Or such ambiguous giving-out, to noteThat you know aught of me–this do swear,So grace and mercy at your most need help you. GHOST, [beneath] Swear. HAMLETRest, rest, perturbed spirit.–So, gentlemen,With all my love I do commend me to you,And what so poor a man as Hamlet isMay do t’ express his love and friending to you,God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.The time is out of joint. O cursed spiteThat ever I was born to set it right!Nay, come, let’s go together.[They exit.] ACT 2Scene 1&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter old Polonius with his man Reynaldo.] POLONIUSGive him this money and these notes, Reynaldo. REYNALDO I will, my lord. POLONIUSYou shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo,Before you visit him, to make inquireOf his behavior. REYNALDO My lord, I did intend it. POLONIUSMarry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;And how, and who, what means, and where theykeep,What company, at what expense; and findingBy this encompassment and drift of questionThat they do know my son, come you more nearerThan your particular demands will touch it.Take you, as ‘twere, some distant knowledge of him,As thus: “I know his father and his friendsAnd, in part, him.” Do you mark this, Reynaldo? REYNALDO Ay, very well, my lord. POLONIUS“And, in part, him, but,” you may say, “not well.But if ‘t be he I mean, he’s very wild,Addicted so and so.” And there put on himWhat forgeries you please–marry, none so rankAs may dishonor him, take heed of that,But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slipsAs are companions noted and most knownTo youth and liberty. REYNALDO As gaming, my lord. POLONIUS Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,Quarreling, drabbing–you may go so far. REYNALDO My lord, that would dishonor him. POLONIUSFaith, no, as you may season it in the charge.You must not put another scandal on himThat he is open to incontinency;That’s not my meaning. But breathe his faults soquaintlyThat they may seem the taints of liberty,The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,A savageness in unreclaimed blood,Of general assault. REYNALDO But, my good lord– POLONIUS Wherefore should you do this? REYNALDO Ay, my lord, I would know that. POLONIUS Marry, sir, here’s my drift,And I believe it is a fetch of wit.You, laying these slight sullies on my son,As ‘twere a thing a little soiled i’ th’ working,Mark you, your party in converse, him you wouldsound,Having ever seen in the prenominate crimesThe youth you breathe of guilty, be assuredHe closes with you in this consequence:“Good sir,” or so, or “friend,” or “gentleman,”According to the phrase or the additionOf man and country– REYNALDO Very good, my lord. POLONIUS And then, sir, does he this, he does–whatwas I about to say? By the Mass, I was about to saysomething. Where did I leave? REYNALDO At “closes in the consequence,” at “friend,or so,” and “gentleman.” POLONIUSAt “closes in the consequence”–ay, marry–He closes thus: “I know the gentleman.I saw him yesterday,” or “th’ other day”(Or then, or then, with such or such), “and as yousay,There was he gaming, there o’ertook in ‘s rouse,There falling out at tennis”; or perchance“I saw him enter such a house of sale”–Videlicet, a brothel–or so forth. See you nowYour bait of falsehood take this carp of truth;And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,With windlasses and with assays of bias,By indirections find directions out.So by my former lecture and adviceShall you my son. You have me, have you not? REYNALDOMy lord, I have. POLONIUS God be wi’ you. Fare you well. REYNALDO Good my lord. POLONIUSObserve his inclination in yourself. REYNALDO I shall, my lord. POLONIUS And let him ply his music. REYNALDO Well, my lord. POLONIUSFarewell. [Reynaldo exits.] [Enter Ophelia.] How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter? OPHELIAO, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted! POLONIUS With what, i’ th’ name of God? OPHELIAMy lord, as I was sewing in my closet,Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,No hat upon his head, his stockings fouled,Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ankle,Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,And with a look so piteous in purportAs if he had been loosed out of hellTo speak of horrors–he comes before me. POLONIUSMad for thy love? OPHELIA My lord, I do not know,But truly I do fear it. POLONIUS What said he? OPHELIAHe took me by the wrist and held me hard.Then goes he to the length of all his arm,And, with his other hand thus o’er his brow,He falls to such perusal of my faceAs he would draw it. Long stayed he so.At last, a little shaking of mine arm,And thrice his head thus waving up and down,He raised a sigh so piteous and profoundAs it did seem to shatter all his bulkAnd end his being. That done, he lets me go,And, with his head over his shoulder turned,He seemed to find his way without his eyes,For out o’ doors he went without their helpsAnd to the last bended their light on me. POLONIUSCome, go with me. I will go seek the King.This is the very ecstasy of love,Whose violent property fordoes itselfAnd leads the will to desperate undertakingsAs oft as any passions under heavenThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry.What, have you given him any hard words of late? OPHELIANo, my good lord, but as you did commandI did repel his letters and deniedHis access to me. POLONIUS That hath made him mad.I am sorry that with better heed and judgmentI had not coted him. I feared he did but trifleAnd meant to wrack thee. But beshrew my jealousy!By heaven, it is as proper to our ageTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinionsAs it is common for the younger sortTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.This must be known, which, being kept close, mightmoveMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.Come.[They exit.] Scene 2&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Flourish. Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz andGuildenstern and Attendants.] KINGWelcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.Moreover that we much did long to see you,The need we have to use you did provokeOur hasty sending. Something have you heardOf Hamlet’s transformation, so call it,Sith nor th’ exterior nor the inward manResembles that it was. What it should be,More than his father’s death, that thus hath put himSo much from th’ understanding of himselfI cannot dream of. I entreat you bothThat, being of so young days brought up with himAnd sith so neighbored to his youth and havior,That you vouchsafe your rest here in our courtSome little time, so by your companiesTo draw him on to pleasures, and to gatherSo much as from occasion you may glean,Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thusThat, opened, lies within our remedy. QUEENGood gentlemen, he hath much talked of you,And sure I am two men there is not livingTo whom he more adheres. If it will please youTo show us so much gentry and goodwillAs to expend your time with us awhileFor the supply and profit of our hope,Your visitation shall receive such thanksAs fits a king’s remembrance. ROSENCRANTZ Both your MajestiesMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,Put your dread pleasures more into commandThan to entreaty. GUILDENSTERN But we both obey,And here give up ourselves in the full bentTo lay our service freely at your feet,To be commanded. KINGThanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern. QUEENThanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.And I beseech you instantly to visitMy too much changed son.–Go, some of you,And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is. GUILDENSTERNHeavens make our presence and our practicesPleasant and helpful to him! QUEEN Ay, amen![Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exitwith some Attendants.] [Enter Polonius.] POLONIUSTh’ ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,Are joyfully returned. KINGThou still hast been the father of good news. POLONIUSHave I, my lord? I assure my good liegeI hold my duty as I hold my soul,Both to my God and to my gracious king,And I do think, or else this brain of mineHunts not the trail of policy so sureAs it hath used to do, that I have foundThe very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy. KINGO, speak of that! That do I long to hear. POLONIUSGive first admittance to th’ ambassadors.My news shall be the fruit to that great feast. KINGThyself do grace to them and bring them in.[Polonius exits.]He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath foundThe head and source of all your son’s distemper. QUEENI doubt it is no other but the main–His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage. KINGWell, we shall sift him. [Enter Ambassadors Voltemand and Cornelius withPolonius.] Welcome, my good friends.Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway? VOLTEMANDMost fair return of greetings and desires.Upon our first, he sent out to suppressHis nephew’s levies, which to him appearedTo be a preparation ‘gainst the Polack,But, better looked into, he truly foundIt was against your Highness. Whereat, grievedThat so his sickness, age, and impotenceWas falsely borne in hand, sends out arrestsOn Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,Makes vow before his uncle never moreTo give th’ assay of arms against your Majesty.Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,Gives him three-score thousand crowns in annualfeeAnd his commission to employ those soldiers,So levied as before, against the Polack,With an entreaty, herein further shown,[He gives a paper.]That it might please you to give quiet passThrough your dominions for this enterprise,On such regards of safety and allowanceAs therein are set down. KING It likes us well,And, at our more considered time, we’ll read,Answer, and think upon this business.Meantime, we thank you for your well-took labor.Go to your rest. At night we’ll feast together.Most welcome home![Voltemand and Cornelius exit.] POLONIUS This business is well ended.My liege, and madam, to expostulateWhat majesty should be, what duty is,Why day is day, night night, and time is timeWere nothing but to waste night, day, and time.Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.“Mad” call I it, for, to define true madness,What is ‘t but to be nothing else but mad?But let that go. QUEEN More matter with less art. POLONIUSMadam, I swear I use no art at all.That he’s mad, ‘tis true; ‘tis true ‘tis pity,And pity ‘tis ‘tis true–a foolish figure,But farewell it, for I will use no art.Mad let us grant him then, and now remainsThat we find out the cause of this effect,Or, rather say, the cause of this defect,For this effect defective comes by cause.Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.Perpend.I have a daughter (have while she is mine)Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,Hath given me this. Now gather and surmise.[He reads.] To the celestial, and my soul’s idol, themost beautified Ophelia–That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; “beautified” is avile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus: [He reads.]In her excellent white bosom, these, etc.– QUEEN Came this from Hamlet to her? POLONIUSGood madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.[He reads the letter.] Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move, Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love.O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have notart to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, Omost best, believe it. Adieu.Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilstthis machine is to him, Hamlet.This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,And more above, hath his solicitings,As they fell out by time, by means, and place,All given to mine ear. KING But how hath she received his love? POLONIUS What do you think of me? KINGAs of a man faithful and honorable. POLONIUSI would fain prove so. But what might you think,When I had seen this hot love on the wing(As I perceived it, I must tell you that,Before my daughter told me), what might you,Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,If I had played the desk or table-bookOr given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,Or looked upon this love with idle sight?What might you think? No, I went round to work,And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:“Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.This must not be.” And then I prescripts gave her,That she should lock herself from his resort,Admit no messengers, receive no tokens;Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,And he, repelled (a short tale to make),Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,Into the madness wherein now he ravesAnd all we mourn for. KING, [to Queen] Do you think ‘tis this? QUEEN It may be, very like. POLONIUSHath there been such a time (I would fain knowthat)That I have positively said “‘Tis so,”When it proved otherwise? KING Not that I know. POLONIUSTake this from this, if this be otherwise.If circumstances lead me, I will findWhere truth is hid, though it were hid, indeed,Within the center. KING How may we try it further? POLONIUSYou know sometimes he walks four hours togetherHere in the lobby. QUEEN So he does indeed. POLONIUSAt such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.[To the King.] Be you and I behind an arras then.Mark the encounter. If he love her not,And be not from his reason fall’n thereon,Let me be no assistant for a state,But keep a farm and carters. KING We will try it. [Enter Hamlet reading on a book.] QUEENBut look where sadly the poor wretch comesreading. POLONIUSAway, I do beseech you both, away.I’ll board him presently. O, give me leave.[King and Queen exit with Attendants.]How does my good Lord Hamlet? HAMLET Well, God-a-mercy. POLONIUS Do you know me, my lord? HAMLET Excellent well. You are a fishmonger. POLONIUS Not I, my lord. HAMLET Then I would you were so honest a man. POLONIUS Honest, my lord? HAMLET Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is tobe one man picked out of ten thousand. POLONIUS That’s very true, my lord. HAMLET For if the sun breed maggots in a deaddog, being a good kissing carrion–Have you adaughter? POLONIUS I have, my lord. HAMLET Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is ablessing, but, as your daughter may conceive,friend, look to ‘t. POLONIUS, [aside] How say you by that? Still harping onmy daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said Iwas a fishmonger. He is far gone. And truly, in myyouth, I suffered much extremity for love, very nearthis. I’ll speak to him again.–What do you read, mylord? HAMLET Words, words, words. POLONIUS What is the matter, my lord? HAMLET Between who? POLONIUS I mean the matter that you read, my lord. HAMLET Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says herethat old men have gray beards, that their faces arewrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber andplum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack ofwit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir,though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet Ihold it not honesty to have it thus set down; foryourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if, like a crab,you could go backward. POLONIUS, [aside] Though this be madness, yet there ismethod in ‘t.–Will you walk out of the air, my lord? HAMLET Into my grave? POLONIUS Indeed, that’s out of the air. [Aside.] Howpregnant sometimes his replies are! A happinessthat often madness hits on, which reason andsanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. Iwill leave him and suddenly contrive the means ofmeeting between him and my daughter.–My lord,I will take my leave of you. HAMLET You cannot, sir, take from me anything that Iwill more willingly part withal–except my life,except my life, except my life. POLONIUS Fare you well, my lord. HAMLET, [aside] These tedious old fools. [Enter Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.] POLONIUS You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is. ROSENCRANTZ, [to Polonius] God save you, sir.[Polonius exits.] GUILDENSTERN My honored lord. ROSENCRANTZ My most dear lord. HAMLET My excellent good friends! How dost thou,Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how doyou both? ROSENCRANTZAs the indifferent children of the earth. GUILDENSTERNHappy in that we are not overhappy.On Fortune’s cap, we are not the very button. HAMLET Nor the soles of her shoe? ROSENCRANTZ Neither, my lord. HAMLET Then you live about her waist, or in themiddle of her favors? GUILDENSTERN Faith, her privates we. HAMLET In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true!She is a strumpet. What news? ROSENCRANTZ None, my lord, but that the world’sgrown honest. HAMLET Then is doomsday near. But your news is nottrue. Let me question more in particular. Whathave you, my good friends, deserved at the hands ofFortune that she sends you to prison hither? GUILDENSTERN Prison, my lord? HAMLET Denmark’s a prison. ROSENCRANTZ Then is the world one. HAMLET A goodly one, in which there are many confines,wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’th’ worst. ROSENCRANTZ We think not so, my lord. HAMLET Why, then, ‘tis none to you, for there isnothing either good or bad but thinking makes itso. To me, it is a prison. ROSENCRANTZ Why, then, your ambition makes it one.‘Tis too narrow for your mind. HAMLET O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell andcount myself a king of infinite space, were it notthat I have bad dreams. GUILDENSTERN Which dreams, indeed, are ambition,for the very substance of the ambitious is merelythe shadow of a dream. HAMLET A dream itself is but a shadow. ROSENCRANTZ Truly, and I hold ambition of so airyand light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow. HAMLET Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchsand outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows.Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannotreason. ROSENCRANTZ&#x2F;GUILDENSTERN We’ll wait upon you. HAMLET No such matter. I will not sort you with therest of my servants, for, to speak to you like anhonest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But,in the beaten way of friendship, what make you atElsinore? ROSENCRANTZ To visit you, my lord, no other occasion. HAMLET Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks;but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanksare too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for?Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation?Come, come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay,speak. GUILDENSTERN What should we say, my lord? HAMLET Anything but to th’ purpose. You were sentfor, and there is a kind of confession in your lookswhich your modesties have not craft enough tocolor. I know the good king and queen have sent foryou. ROSENCRANTZ To what end, my lord? HAMLET That you must teach me. But let me conjureyou by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancyof our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preservedlove, and by what more dear a betterproposer can charge you withal: be even and directwith me whether you were sent for or no. ROSENCRANTZ, [to Guildenstern] What say you? HAMLET, [aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.–Ifyou love me, hold not off. GUILDENSTERN My lord, we were sent for. HAMLET I will tell you why; so shall my anticipationprevent your discovery, and your secrecy to theKing and Queen molt no feather. I have of late, butwherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone allcustom of exercises, and, indeed, it goes so heavilywith my disposition that this goodly frame, theEarth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this mostexcellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhangingfirmament, this majestical roof, frettedwith golden fire–why, it appeareth nothing to mebut a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.What a piece of work is a man, how noble inreason, how infinite in faculties, in form and movinghow express and admirable; in action how likean angel, in apprehension how like a god: thebeauty of the world, the paragon of animals–andyet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Mandelights not me, no, nor women neither, though byyour smiling you seem to say so. ROSENCRANTZ My lord, there was no such stuff in mythoughts. HAMLET Why did you laugh, then, when I said “mandelights not me”? ROSENCRANTZ To think, my lord, if you delight not inman, what Lenten entertainment the players shallreceive from you. We coted them on the way, andhither are they coming to offer you service. HAMLET He that plays the king shall be welcome–hisMajesty shall have tribute on me. The adventurousknight shall use his foil and target, the lover shallnot sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end hispart in peace, the clown shall make those laughwhose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sear, and the ladyshall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shallhalt for ‘t. What players are they? ROSENCRANTZ Even those you were wont to take suchdelight in, the tragedians of the city. HAMLET How chances it they travel? Their residence,both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. ROSENCRANTZ I think their inhibition comes by themeans of the late innovation. HAMLET Do they hold the same estimation they didwhen I was in the city? Are they so followed? ROSENCRANTZ No, indeed are they not. HAMLET How comes it? Do they grow rusty? ROSENCRANTZ Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wontedpace. But there is, sir, an aerie of children, littleeyases, that cry out on the top of question and aremost tyrannically clapped for ‘t. These are now thefashion and so berattle the common stages (sothey call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraidof goose quills and dare scarce come thither. HAMLET What, are they children? Who maintains ‘em?How are they escoted? Will they pursue the qualityno longer than they can sing? Will they not sayafterwards, if they should grow themselves to commonplayers (as it is most like, if their means areno better), their writers do them wrong to makethem exclaim against their own succession? ROSENCRANTZ Faith, there has been much to-do onboth sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tarthem to controversy. There was for a while nomoney bid for argument unless the poet and theplayer went to cuffs in the question. HAMLET Is ‘t possible? GUILDENSTERN O, there has been much throwingabout of brains. HAMLET Do the boys carry it away? ROSENCRANTZ Ay, that they do, my lord–Herculesand his load too. HAMLET It is not very strange; for my uncle is King ofDenmark, and those that would make mouths athim while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty,a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.‘Sblood, there is something in this more than natural,if philosophy could find it out.[A flourish for the Players.] GUILDENSTERN There are the players. HAMLET Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.Your hands, come then. Th’ appurtenance of welcomeis fashion and ceremony. Let me complywith you in this garb, lest my extent to the players,which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, shouldmore appear like entertainment than yours. You arewelcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother aredeceived. GUILDENSTERN In what, my dear lord? HAMLET I am but mad north-north-west. When thewind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw. [Enter Polonius.] POLONIUS Well be with you, gentlemen. HAMLET Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too–ateach ear a hearer! That great baby you see there isnot yet out of his swaddling clouts. ROSENCRANTZ Haply he is the second time come tothem, for they say an old man is twice a child. HAMLET I will prophesy he comes to tell me of theplayers; mark it.–You say right, sir, a Mondaymorning, ‘twas then indeed. POLONIUS My lord, I have news to tell you. HAMLET My lord, I have news to tell you: when Rosciuswas an actor in Rome– POLONIUS The actors are come hither, my lord. HAMLET Buzz, buzz. POLONIUS Upon my honor– HAMLET Then came each actor on his ass. POLONIUS The best actors in the world, either fortragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, orpoem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, norPlautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty,these are the only men. HAMLET O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasurehadst thou! POLONIUS What a treasure had he, my lord? HAMLET Why, One fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved passing well. POLONIUS, [aside] Still on my daughter. HAMLET Am I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah? POLONIUS If you call me “Jephthah,” my lord: I have adaughter that I love passing well. HAMLET Nay, that follows not. POLONIUS What follows then, my lord? HAMLET Why, As by lot, God wotand then, you know, It came to pass, as most like it was–the first row of the pious chanson will show youmore, for look where my abridgment comes. [Enter the Players.] You are welcome, masters; welcome all.–I am gladto see thee well.–Welcome, good friends.–O myold friend! Why, thy face is valanced since I saw theelast. Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark?–What,my young lady and mistress! By ‘r Lady, your Ladyshipis nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, bythe altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within thering. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to ‘tlike French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’llhave a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of yourquality. Come, a passionate speech. FIRST PLAYER What speech, my good lord? HAMLET I heard thee speak me a speech once, but itwas never acted, or, if it was, not above once; forthe play, I remember, pleased not the million:‘twas caviary to the general. But it was (as Ireceived it, and others whose judgments in suchmatters cried in the top of mine) an excellent play,well digested in the scenes, set down with as muchmodesty as cunning. I remember one said therewere no sallets in the lines to make the mattersavory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indictthe author of affection, but called it an honestmethod, as wholesome as sweet and, by very much,more handsome than fine. One speech in ‘t Ichiefly loved. ‘Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, andthereabout of it especially when he speaks ofPriam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin atthis line–let me see, let me see:The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast–‘tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,Black as his purpose, did the night resembleWhen he lay couched in th’ ominous horse,Hath now this dread and black complexion smearedWith heraldry more dismal. Head to foot,Now is he total gules, horridly trickedWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,Baked and impasted with the parching streets,That lend a tyrannous and a damned lightTo their lord’s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore,With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish PyrrhusOld grandsire Priam seeks.So, proceed you. POLONIUS ‘Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with goodaccent and good discretion. FIRST PLAYER Anon he finds himStriking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,Repugnant to command. Unequal matched,Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;But with the whiff and wind of his fell swordTh’ unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming topStoops to his base, and with a hideous crashTakes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword,Which was declining on the milky headOf reverend Priam, seemed i’ th’ air to stick.So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stoodAnd, like a neutral to his will and matter,Did nothing.But as we often see against some stormA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,The bold winds speechless, and the orb belowAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunderDoth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus’ pause,Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work,And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fallOn Mars’s armor, forged for proof eterne,With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding swordNow falls on Priam.Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you godsIn general synod take away her power,Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,And bowl the round nave down the hill of heavenAs low as to the fiends! POLONIUS This is too long. HAMLET It shall to the barber’s with your beard.–Prithee say on. He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, orhe sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba. FIRST PLAYERBut who, ah woe, had seen the mobled queen– HAMLET “The mobled queen”? POLONIUS That’s good. “Mobled queen” is good. FIRST PLAYERRun barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flamesWith bisson rheum, a clout upon that headWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,About her lank and all o’erteemed loinsA blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up–Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steeped,‘Gainst Fortune’s state would treason havepronounced.But if the gods themselves did see her thenWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sportIn mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs,The instant burst of clamor that she made(Unless things mortal move them not at all)Would have made milch the burning eyes of heavenAnd passion in the gods. POLONIUS Look whe’er he has not turned his color andhas tears in ‘s eyes. Prithee, no more. HAMLET ‘Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest ofthis soon.–Good my lord, will you see the playerswell bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used,for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of thetime. After your death you were better have a badepitaph than their ill report while you live. POLONIUS My lord, I will use them according to theirdesert. HAMLET God’s bodykins, man, much better! Use everyman after his desert and who shall ‘scapewhipping? Use them after your own honor anddignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is inyour bounty. Take them in. POLONIUS Come, sirs. HAMLET Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a playtomorrow. [As Polonius and Players exit, Hamlet speaks tothe First Player.] Dost thou hear me, old friend? Canyou play “The Murder of Gonzago”? FIRST PLAYER Ay, my lord. HAMLET We’ll ha ‘t tomorrow night. You could, for aneed, study a speech of some dozen or sixteenlines, which I would set down and insert in ‘t,could you not? FIRST PLAYER Ay, my lord. HAMLET Very well. Follow that lord–and look youmock him not. [First Player exits.] My good friends,I’ll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore. ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord. HAMLETAy, so, good-bye to you.[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]Now I am alone.O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!Is it not monstrous that this player here,But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,Could force his soul so to his own conceitThat from her working all his visage wanned,Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,A broken voice, and his whole function suitingWith forms to his conceit–and all for nothing!For Hecuba!What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,That he should weep for her? What would he doHad he the motive and the cue for passionThat I have? He would drown the stage with tearsAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,Make mad the guilty and appall the free,Confound the ignorant and amaze indeedThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peakLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,And can say nothing–no, not for a kingUpon whose property and most dear lifeA damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?Who calls me “villain”? breaks my pate across?Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i’ th’ throatAs deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?Ha! ‘Swounds, I should take it! For it cannot beBut I am pigeon-livered and lack gallTo make oppression bitter, or ere thisI should have fatted all the region kitesWith this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindlessvillain!O vengeance!Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,That I, the son of a dear father murdered,Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with wordsAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,A stallion! Fie upon ‘t! Foh!About, my brains!–Hum, I have heardThat guilty creatures sitting at a playHave, by the very cunning of the scene,Been struck so to the soul that presentlyThey have proclaimed their malefactions;For murder, though it have no tongue, will speakWith most miraculous organ. I’ll have these playersPlay something like the murder of my fatherBefore mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;I’ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,I know my course. The spirit that I have seenMay be a devil, and the devil hath powerT’ assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,Out of my weakness and my melancholy,As he is very potent with such spirits,Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have groundsMore relative than this. The play’s the thingWherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.[He exits.] ACT 3&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Scene 1&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,Guildenstern, and Lords.] KINGAnd can you by no drift of conferenceGet from him why he puts on this confusion,Grating so harshly all his days of quietWith turbulent and dangerous lunacy? ROSENCRANTZHe does confess he feels himself distracted,But from what cause he will by no means speak. GUILDENSTERNNor do we find him forward to be sounded,But with a crafty madness keeps aloofWhen we would bring him on to some confessionOf his true state. QUEEN Did he receive you well? ROSENCRANTZ Most like a gentleman. GUILDENSTERNBut with much forcing of his disposition. ROSENCRANTZNiggard of question, but of our demandsMost free in his reply. QUEEN Did you assay him to any pastime? ROSENCRANTZMadam, it so fell out that certain playersWe o’erraught on the way. Of these we told him,And there did seem in him a kind of joyTo hear of it. They are here about the court,And, as I think, they have already orderThis night to play before him. POLONIUS ‘Tis most true,And he beseeched me to entreat your MajestiesTo hear and see the matter. KINGWith all my heart, and it doth much content meTo hear him so inclined.Good gentlemen, give him a further edgeAnd drive his purpose into these delights. ROSENCRANTZWe shall, my lord. [Rosencrantz and Guildensternand Lords exit.] KING Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,That he, as ‘twere by accident, may hereAffront Ophelia.Her father and myself, lawful espials,Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,We may of their encounter frankly judgeAnd gather by him, as he is behaved,If ‘t be th’ affliction of his love or noThat thus he suffers for. QUEEN I shall obey you.And for your part, Ophelia, I do wishThat your good beauties be the happy causeOf Hamlet’s wildness. So shall I hope your virtuesWill bring him to his wonted way again,To both your honors. OPHELIA Madam, I wish it may.[Queen exits.] POLONIUSOphelia, walk you here.–Gracious, so please you,We will bestow ourselves. [To Ophelia.] Read on thisbook,That show of such an exercise may colorYour loneliness.–We are oft to blame in this(‘Tis too much proved), that with devotion’s visageAnd pious action we do sugar o’erThe devil himself. KING, [aside] O, ‘tis too true!How smart a lash that speech doth give myconscience.The harlot’s cheek beautied with plast’ring artIs not more ugly to the thing that helps itThan is my deed to my most painted word.O heavy burden! POLONIUSI hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord.[They withdraw.] [Enter Hamlet.] HAMLETTo be or not to be–that is the question:Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take arms against a sea of troublesAnd, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep–No more–and by a sleep to say we endThe heartache and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to–’tis a consummationDevoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep–To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there’s the rub,For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause. There’s the respectThat makes calamity of so long life.For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,The insolence of office, and the spurnsThat patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,When he himself might his quietus makeWith a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,To grunt and sweat under a weary life,But that the dread of something after death,The undiscovered country from whose bournNo traveler returns, puzzles the willAnd makes us rather bear those ills we haveThan fly to others that we know not of?Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,And thus the native hue of resolutionIs sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,And enterprises of great pitch and momentWith this regard their currents turn awryAnd lose the name of action.–Soft you now,The fair Ophelia.–Nymph, in thy orisonsBe all my sins remembered. OPHELIA Good my lord,How does your Honor for this many a day? HAMLET I humbly thank you, well. OPHELIAMy lord, I have remembrances of yoursThat I have longed long to redeliver.I pray you now receive them. HAMLETNo, not I. I never gave you aught. OPHELIAMy honored lord, you know right well you did,And with them words of so sweet breath composedAs made the things more rich. Their perfumelost,Take these again, for to the noble mindRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.There, my lord. HAMLET Ha, ha, are you honest? OPHELIA My lord? HAMLET Are you fair? OPHELIA What means your Lordship? HAMLET That if you be honest and fair, your honestyshould admit no discourse to your beauty. OPHELIA Could beauty, my lord, have better commercethan with honesty? HAMLET Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will soonertransform honesty from what it is to a bawd thanthe force of honesty can translate beauty into hislikeness. This was sometime a paradox, but nowthe time gives it proof. I did love you once. OPHELIA Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so. HAMLET You should not have believed me, for virtuecannot so inoculate our old stock but we shallrelish of it. I loved you not. OPHELIA I was the more deceived. HAMLET Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou bea breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest,but yet I could accuse me of such things that itwere better my mother had not borne me: I amvery proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offensesat my beck than I have thoughts to put themin, imagination to give them shape, or time to actthem in. What should such fellows as I do crawlingbetween earth and heaven? We are arrant knavesall; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.Where’s your father? OPHELIA At home, my lord. HAMLET Let the doors be shut upon him that he mayplay the fool nowhere but in ‘s own house. Farewell. OPHELIA O, help him, you sweet heavens! HAMLET If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plaguefor thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure assnow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to anunnery, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry,marry a fool, for wise men know well enough whatmonsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, andquickly too. Farewell. OPHELIA Heavenly powers, restore him! HAMLET I have heard of your paintings too, wellenough. God hath given you one face, and youmake yourselves another. You jig and amble, andyou lisp; you nickname God’s creatures and makeyour wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll nomore on ‘t. It hath made me mad. I say we will haveno more marriage. Those that are married already,all but one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.To a nunnery, go. [He exits.] OPHELIAO, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue,sword,Th’ expectancy and rose of the fair state,The glass of fashion and the mold of form,Th’ observed of all observers, quite, quite down!And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,That sucked the honey of his musicked vows,Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,Like sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh;That unmatched form and stature of blown youthBlasted with ecstasy. O, woe is meT’ have seen what I have seen, see what I see! KING, [advancing with Polonius]Love? His affections do not that way tend;Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,Was not like madness. There’s something in his soulO’er which his melancholy sits on brood,And I do doubt the hatch and the discloseWill be some danger; which for to prevent,I have in quick determinationThus set it down: he shall with speed to EnglandFor the demand of our neglected tribute.Haply the seas, and countries different,With variable objects, shall expelThis something-settled matter in his heart,Whereon his brains still beating puts him thusFrom fashion of himself. What think you on ‘t? POLONIUSIt shall do well. But yet do I believeThe origin and commencement of his griefSprung from neglected love.–How now, Ophelia?You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;We heard it all.–My lord, do as you please,But, if you hold it fit, after the playLet his queen-mother all alone entreat himTo show his grief. Let her be round with him;And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the earOf all their conference. If she find him not,To England send him, or confine him whereYour wisdom best shall think. KING It shall be so.Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.[They exit.] Scene 2&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.] HAMLET Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronouncedit to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouthit, as many of our players do, I had as lief thetown-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the airtoo much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire andbeget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O,it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious,periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to veryrags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for themost part are capable of nothing but inexplicabledumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellowwhipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-HerodsHerod. Pray you, avoid it. PLAYER I warrant your Honor. HAMLET Be not too tame neither, but let your owndiscretion be your tutor. Suit the action to theword, the word to the action, with this specialobservance, that you o’erstep not the modesty ofnature. For anything so o’erdone is from the purposeof playing, whose end, both at the first andnow, was and is to hold, as ‘twere, the mirror up tonature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn herown image, and the very age and body of the timehis form and pressure. Now this overdone or cometardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh,cannot but make the judicious grieve, the censureof the which one must in your allowance o’erweigha whole theater of others. O, there be players that Ihave seen play and heard others praise (and thathighly), not to speak it profanely, that, neitherhaving th’ accent of Christians nor the gait ofChristian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted andbellowed that I have thought some of nature’sjourneymen had made men, and not made themwell, they imitated humanity so abominably. PLAYER I hope we have reformed that indifferentlywith us, sir. HAMLET O, reform it altogether. And let those that playyour clowns speak no more than is set down forthem, for there be of them that will themselveslaugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectatorsto laugh too, though in the meantime some necessaryquestion of the play be then to be considered.That’s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambitionin the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.[Players exit.] [Enter Polonius, Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz.] How now, my lord, will the King hear this piece ofwork? POLONIUS And the Queen too, and that presently. HAMLET Bid the players make haste. [Polonius exits.]Will you two help to hasten them? ROSENCRANTZ Ay, my lord. [They exit.] HAMLET What ho, Horatio! [Enter Horatio.] HORATIO Here, sweet lord, at your service. HAMLETHoratio, thou art e’en as just a manAs e’er my conversation coped withal. HORATIOO, my dear lord– HAMLET Nay, do not think I flatter,For what advancement may I hope from theeThat no revenue hast but thy good spiritsTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor beflattered?No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pompAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the kneeWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?Since my dear soul was mistress of her choiceAnd could of men distinguish, her electionHath sealed thee for herself. For thou hast beenAs one in suffering all that suffers nothing,A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewardsHast ta’en with equal thanks; and blessed are thoseWhose blood and judgment are so wellcommeddledThat they are not a pipe for Fortune’s fingerTo sound what stop she please. Give me that manThat is not passion’s slave, and I will wear himIn my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart,As I do thee.–Something too much of this.–There is a play tonight before the King.One scene of it comes near the circumstanceWhich I have told thee of my father’s death.I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,Even with the very comment of thy soulObserve my uncle. If his occulted guiltDo not itself unkennel in one speech,It is a damned ghost that we have seen,And my imaginations are as foulAs Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note,For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,And, after, we will both our judgments joinIn censure of his seeming. HORATIO Well, my lord.If he steal aught the whilst this play is playingAnd ‘scape detecting, I will pay the theft.[Sound a flourish.] HAMLET They are coming to the play. I must be idle.Get you a place. [Enter Trumpets and Kettle Drums. Enter King, Queen,Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and otherLords attendant with the King’s guard carryingtorches.] KING How fares our cousin Hamlet? HAMLET Excellent, i’ faith, of the chameleon’s dish. Ieat the air, promise-crammed. You cannot feedcapons so. KING I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. Thesewords are not mine. HAMLET No, nor mine now. [To Polonius.] My lord, youplayed once i’ th’ university, you say? POLONIUS That did I, my lord, and was accounted agood actor. HAMLET What did you enact? POLONIUS I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i’ th’Capitol. Brutus killed me. HAMLET It was a brute part of him to kill so capital acalf there.–Be the players ready? ROSENCRANTZ Ay, my lord. They stay upon yourpatience. QUEEN Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me. HAMLET No, good mother. Here’s metal moreattractive. [Hamlet takes a place near Ophelia.] POLONIUS, [to the King] Oh, ho! Do you mark that? HAMLET Lady, shall I lie in your lap? OPHELIA No, my lord. HAMLET I mean, my head upon your lap? OPHELIA Ay, my lord. HAMLET Do you think I meant country matters? OPHELIA I think nothing, my lord. HAMLET That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’legs. OPHELIA What is, my lord? HAMLET Nothing. OPHELIA You are merry, my lord. HAMLET Who, I? OPHELIA Ay, my lord. HAMLET O God, your only jig-maker. What should aman do but be merry? For look you how cheerfullymy mother looks, and my father died within ‘s twohours. OPHELIA Nay, ‘tis twice two months, my lord. HAMLET So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black,for I’ll have a suit of sables. O heavens, die twomonths ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’shope a great man’s memory may outlive his life halfa year. But, by ‘r Lady, he must build churches, then,or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with thehobby-horse, whose epitaph is “For oh, for oh, thehobby-horse is forgot.”[The trumpets sounds. Dumb show follows.] [Enter a King and a Queen, very lovingly, the Queenembracing him and he her. She kneels and makes show ofprotestation unto him. He takes her up and declines hishead upon her neck. He lies him down upon a bank offlowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anoncomes in another man, takes off his crown, kisses it, pourspoison in the sleeper’s ears, and leaves him. The Queenreturns, finds the King dead, makes passionate action. Thepoisoner with some three or four come in again, seem tocondole with her. The dead body is carried away. Thepoisoner woos the Queen with gifts. She seems harshawhile but in the end accepts his love.][Players exit.] OPHELIA What means this, my lord? HAMLET Marry, this is miching mallecho. It meansmischief. OPHELIA Belike this show imports the argument of theplay. [Enter Prologue.] HAMLET We shall know by this fellow. The playerscannot keep counsel; they’ll tell all. OPHELIA Will he tell us what this show meant? HAMLET Ay, or any show that you will show him. Benot you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell youwhat it means. OPHELIA You are naught, you are naught. I’ll mark theplay. PROLOGUE For us and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently. [He exits.] HAMLET Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring? OPHELIA ‘Tis brief, my lord. HAMLET As woman’s love. [Enter the Player King and Queen.] PLAYER KINGFull thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone roundNeptune’s salt wash and Tellus’ orbed ground,And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheenAbout the world have times twelve thirties beenSince love our hearts and Hymen did our handsUnite commutual in most sacred bands. PLAYER QUEENSo many journeys may the sun and moonMake us again count o’er ere love be done!But woe is me! You are so sick of late,So far from cheer and from your former state,That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.For women fear too much, even as they love,And women’s fear and love hold quantity,In neither aught, or in extremity.Now what my love is, proof hath made you know,And, as my love is sized, my fear is so:Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;Where little fears grow great, great love grows there. PLAYER KINGFaith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too.My operant powers their functions leave to do.And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,Honored, beloved; and haply one as kindFor husband shalt thou– PLAYER QUEEN O, confound the rest!Such love must needs be treason in my breast.In second husband let me be accurst.None wed the second but who killed the first. HAMLET That’s wormwood! PLAYER QUEENThe instances that second marriage moveAre base respects of thrift, but none of love.A second time I kill my husband deadWhen second husband kisses me in bed. PLAYER KINGI do believe you think what now you speak,But what we do determine oft we break.Purpose is but the slave to memory,Of violent birth, but poor validity,Which now, the fruit unripe, sticks on the treeBut fall unshaken when they mellow be.Most necessary ‘tis that we forgetTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.What to ourselves in passion we propose,The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.The violence of either grief or joyTheir own enactures with themselves destroy.Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.This world is not for aye, nor ‘tis not strangeThat even our loves should with our fortunes change;For ‘tis a question left us yet to proveWhether love lead fortune or else fortune love.The great man down, you mark his favorite flies;The poor, advanced, makes friends of enemies.And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,For who not needs shall never lack a friend,And who in want a hollow friend doth tryDirectly seasons him his enemy.But, orderly to end where I begun:Our wills and fates do so contrary runThat our devices still are overthrown;Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.So think thou wilt no second husband wed,But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead. PLAYER QUEENNor Earth to me give food, nor heaven light,Sport and repose lock from me day and night,To desperation turn my trust and hope,An anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope.Each opposite that blanks the face of joyMeet what I would have well and it destroy.Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,If, once a widow, ever I be wife. HAMLET If she should break it now! PLAYER KING‘Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguileThe tedious day with sleep. [Sleeps.] PLAYER QUEEN Sleep rock thy brain,And never come mischance between us twain.[Player Queen exits.] HAMLET Madam, how like you this play? QUEEN The lady doth protest too much, methinks. HAMLET O, but she’ll keep her word. KING Have you heard the argument? Is there nooffense in ‘t? HAMLET No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest. Nooffense i’ th’ world. KING What do you call the play? HAMLET “The Mousetrap.” Marry, how? Tropically.This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.Gonzago is the duke’s name, his wife Baptista. Youshall see anon. ‘Tis a knavish piece of work, butwhat of that? Your Majesty and we that have freesouls, it touches us not. Let the galled jade wince;our withers are unwrung. [Enter Lucianus.] This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king. OPHELIA You are as good as a chorus, my lord. HAMLET I could interpret between you and your love,if I could see the puppets dallying. OPHELIA You are keen, my lord, you are keen. HAMLET It would cost you a groaning to take off mineedge. OPHELIA Still better and worse. HAMLET So you mis-take your husbands.–Begin,murderer. Pox, leave thy damnable faces andbegin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow forrevenge. LUCIANUSThoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and timeagreeing,Confederate season, else no creature seeing,Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,With Hecate’s ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,Thy natural magic and dire propertyOn wholesome life usurp immediately.[Pours the poison in his ears.] HAMLET He poisons him i’ th’ garden for his estate. Hisname’s Gonzago. The story is extant and written invery choice Italian. You shall see anon how themurderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.[Claudius rises.] OPHELIA The King rises. HAMLET What, frighted with false fire? QUEEN How fares my lord? POLONIUS Give o’er the play. KING Give me some light. Away! POLONIUS Lights, lights, lights![All but Hamlet and Horatio exit.] HAMLET Why, let the strucken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play. For some must watch, while some must sleep: Thus runs the world away.Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers (if therest of my fortunes turn Turk with me) with twoProvincial roses on my razed shoes, get me afellowship in a cry of players? HORATIO Half a share. HAMLET A whole one, I. For thou dost know, O Damon dear, This realm dismantled was Of Jove himself, and now reigns here A very very–pajock. HORATIO You might have rhymed. HAMLET O good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost’s word fora thousand pound. Didst perceive? HORATIO Very well, my lord. HAMLET Upon the talk of the poisoning? HORATIO I did very well note him. HAMLET Ah ha! Come, some music! Come, therecorders! For if the King like not the comedy, Why, then, belike he likes it not, perdy.Come, some music! [Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.] GUILDENSTERN Good my lord, vouchsafe me a wordwith you. HAMLET Sir, a whole history. GUILDENSTERN The King, sir– HAMLET Ay, sir, what of him? GUILDENSTERN Is in his retirement marvelousdistempered. HAMLET With drink, sir? GUILDENSTERN No, my lord, with choler. HAMLET Your wisdom should show itself more richerto signify this to the doctor, for for me to put him tohis purgation would perhaps plunge him into morecholer. GUILDENSTERN Good my lord, put your discourse intosome frame and start not so wildly from myaffair. HAMLET I am tame, sir. Pronounce. GUILDENSTERN The Queen your mother, in most greataffliction of spirit, hath sent me to you. HAMLET You are welcome. GUILDENSTERN Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is notof the right breed. If it shall please you to make mea wholesome answer, I will do your mother’scommandment. If not, your pardon and my returnshall be the end of my business. HAMLET Sir, I cannot. ROSENCRANTZ What, my lord? HAMLET Make you a wholesome answer. My wit’sdiseased. But, sir, such answer as I can make, youshall command–or, rather, as you say, my mother.Therefore no more but to the matter. My mother,you say– ROSENCRANTZ Then thus she says: your behavior hathstruck her into amazement and admiration. HAMLET O wonderful son that can so ‘stonish a mother!But is there no sequel at the heels of thismother’s admiration? Impart. ROSENCRANTZ She desires to speak with you in hercloset ere you go to bed. HAMLET We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.Have you any further trade with us? ROSENCRANTZ My lord, you once did love me. HAMLET And do still, by these pickers and stealers. ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord, what is your cause ofdistemper? You do surely bar the door upon yourown liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend. HAMLET Sir, I lack advancement. ROSENCRANTZ How can that be, when you have thevoice of the King himself for your succession inDenmark? HAMLET Ay, sir, but “While the grass grows”–theproverb is something musty. [Enter the Players with recorders.] O, the recorders! Let me see one. [He takes arecorder and turns to Guildenstern.] To withdrawwith you: why do you go about to recover the windof me, as if you would drive me into a toil? GUILDENSTERN O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, mylove is too unmannerly. HAMLET I do not well understand that. Will you playupon this pipe? GUILDENSTERN My lord, I cannot. HAMLET I pray you. GUILDENSTERN Believe me, I cannot. HAMLET I do beseech you. GUILDENSTERN I know no touch of it, my lord. HAMLET It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventageswith your fingers and thumb, give it breath withyour mouth, and it will discourse most eloquentmusic. Look you, these are the stops. GUILDENSTERN But these cannot I command to anyutt’rance of harmony. I have not the skill. HAMLET Why, look you now, how unworthy a thingyou make of me! You would play upon me, youwould seem to know my stops, you would pluckout the heart of my mystery, you would sound mefrom my lowest note to the top of my compass;and there is much music, excellent voice, in thislittle organ, yet cannot you make it speak. ‘Sblood,do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?Call me what instrument you will, though you canfret me, you cannot play upon me. [Enter Polonius.] God bless you, sir. POLONIUS My lord, the Queen would speak with you,and presently. HAMLET Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost inshape of a camel? POLONIUS By th’ Mass, and ‘tis like a camel indeed. HAMLET Methinks it is like a weasel. POLONIUS It is backed like a weasel. HAMLET Or like a whale. POLONIUS Very like a whale. HAMLET Then I will come to my mother by and by.[Aside.] They fool me to the top of my bent.–I willcome by and by. POLONIUS I will say so. HAMLET “By and by” is easily said. Leave me,friends.[All but Hamlet exit.]‘Tis now the very witching time of night,When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathesoutContagion to this world. Now could I drink hotbloodAnd do such bitter business as the dayWould quake to look on. Soft, now to my mother.O heart, lose not thy nature; let not everThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.Let me be cruel, not unnatural.I will speak daggers to her, but use none.My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites:How in my words somever she be shent,To give them seals never, my soul, consent.[He exits.] Scene 3&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.] KINGI like him not, nor stands it safe with usTo let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.I your commission will forthwith dispatch,And he to England shall along with you.The terms of our estate may not endureHazard so near ‘s as doth hourly growOut of his brows. GUILDENSTERN We will ourselves provide.Most holy and religious fear it isTo keep those many many bodies safeThat live and feed upon your Majesty. ROSENCRANTZThe single and peculiar life is boundWith all the strength and armor of the mindTo keep itself from noyance, but much moreThat spirit upon whose weal depends and restsThe lives of many. The cess of majestyDies not alone, but like a gulf doth drawWhat’s near it with it; or it is a massy wheelFixed on the summit of the highest mount,To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser thingsAre mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls,Each small annexment, petty consequence,Attends the boist’rous ruin. Never aloneDid the king sigh, but with a general groan. KINGArm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,For we will fetters put about this fear,Which now goes too free-footed. ROSENCRANTZ We will haste us.[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.] [Enter Polonius.] POLONIUSMy lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.Behind the arras I’ll convey myselfTo hear the process. I’ll warrant she’ll tax himhome;And, as you said (and wisely was it said),‘Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,Since nature makes them partial, should o’erhearThe speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.I’ll call upon you ere you go to bedAnd tell you what I know. KING Thanks, dear my lord.[Polonius exits.]O, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven;It hath the primal eldest curse upon ‘t,A brother’s murder. Pray can I not,Though inclination be as sharp as will.My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,And, like a man to double business bound,I stand in pause where I shall first beginAnd both neglect. What if this cursed handWere thicker than itself with brother’s blood?Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavensTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercyBut to confront the visage of offense?And what’s in prayer but this twofold force,To be forestalled ere we come to fall,Or pardoned being down? Then I’ll look up.My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayerCan serve my turn? “Forgive me my foul murder”?That cannot be, since I am still possessedOf those effects for which I did the murder:My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.May one be pardoned and retain th’ offense?In the corrupted currents of this world,Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice,And oft ‘tis seen the wicked prize itselfBuys out the law. But ‘tis not so above:There is no shuffling; there the action liesIn his true nature, and we ourselves compelled,Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,To give in evidence. What then? What rests?Try what repentance can. What can it not?Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?O wretched state! O bosom black as death!O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay.Bow, stubborn knees, and heart with strings of steelBe soft as sinews of the newborn babe.All may be well. [He kneels.] [Enter Hamlet.] HAMLETNow might I do it pat, now he is a-praying,And now I’ll do ‘t. [He draws his sword.]And so he goes to heaven,And so am I revenged. That would be scanned:A villain kills my father, and for that,I, his sole son, do this same villain sendTo heaven.Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.He took my father grossly, full of bread,With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;And how his audit stands who knows save heaven.But in our circumstance and course of thought‘Tis heavy with him. And am I then revengedTo take him in the purging of his soul,When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?No.Up sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.[He sheathes his sword.]When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,Or in th’ incestuous pleasure of his bed,At game, a-swearing, or about some actThat has no relish of salvation in ‘t–Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,And that his soul may be as damned and blackAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.[Hamlet exits.] KING, [rising]My words fly up, my thoughts remain below;Words without thoughts never to heaven go.[He exits.] Scene 4&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter Queen and Polonius.] POLONIUSHe will come straight. Look you lay home to him.Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bearwithAnd that your Grace hath screened and stoodbetweenMuch heat and him. I’ll silence me even here.Pray you, be round with him. HAMLET, [within] Mother, mother, mother! QUEEN I’ll warrant you. Fear me not. Withdraw,I hear him coming.[Polonius hides behind the arras.] [Enter Hamlet.] HAMLET Now, mother, what’s the matter? QUEENHamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. HAMLETMother, you have my father much offended. QUEENCome, come, you answer with an idle tongue. HAMLETGo, go, you question with a wicked tongue. QUEENWhy, how now, Hamlet? HAMLET What’s the matter now? QUEENHave you forgot me? HAMLET No, by the rood, not so.You are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife,And (would it were not so) you are my mother. QUEENNay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak. HAMLETCome, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge.You go not till I set you up a glassWhere you may see the inmost part of you. QUEENWhat wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?Help, ho! POLONIUS, [behind the arras] What ho! Help! HAMLETHow now, a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead.[He kills Polonius by thrusting a rapierthrough the arras.] POLONIUS, [behind the arras]O, I am slain! QUEEN O me, what hast thou done? HAMLET Nay, I know not. Is it the King? QUEENO, what a rash and bloody deed is this! HAMLETA bloody deed–almost as bad, good mother,As kill a king and marry with his brother. QUEENAs kill a king? HAMLET Ay, lady, it was my word.[He pulls Polonius’ body from behind the arras.]Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell.I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.[To Queen.] Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sityou down,And let me wring your heart; for so I shallIf it be made of penetrable stuff,If damned custom have not brazed it soThat it be proof and bulwark against sense. QUEENWhat have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongueIn noise so rude against me? HAMLET Such an actThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the roseFrom the fair forehead of an innocent loveAnd sets a blister there, makes marriage vowsAs false as dicers’ oaths–O, such a deedAs from the body of contraction plucksThe very soul, and sweet religion makesA rhapsody of words! Heaven’s face does glowO’er this solidity and compound massWith heated visage, as against the doom,Is thought-sick at the act. QUEEN Ay me, what actThat roars so loud and thunders in the index? HAMLETLook here upon this picture and on this,The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.See what a grace was seated on this brow,Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,An eye like Mars’ to threaten and command,A station like the herald MercuryNew-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,A combination and a form indeedWhere every god did seem to set his sealTo give the world assurance of a man.This was your husband. Look you now what follows.Here is your husband, like a mildewed earBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?Could you on this fair mountain leave to feedAnd batten on this moor? Ha! Have you eyes?You cannot call it love, for at your ageThe heyday in the blood is tame, it’s humbleAnd waits upon the judgment; and what judgmentWould step from this to this? Sense sure you have,Else could you not have motion; but sure that senseIs apoplexed; for madness would not err,Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thralled,But it reserved some quantity of choiceTo serve in such a difference. What devil was ‘tThat thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,Or but a sickly part of one true senseCould not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?Rebellious hell,If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,To flaming youth let virtue be as waxAnd melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shameWhen the compulsive ardor gives the charge,Since frost itself as actively doth burn,And reason panders will. QUEEN O Hamlet, speak no more!Thou turn’st my eyes into my very soul,And there I see such black and grained spotsAs will not leave their tinct. HAMLET Nay, but to liveIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,Stewed in corruption, honeying and making loveOver the nasty sty! QUEEN O, speak to me no more!These words like daggers enter in my ears.No more, sweet Hamlet! HAMLET A murderer and a villain,A slave that is not twentieth part the titheOf your precedent lord; a vice of kings,A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,That from a shelf the precious diadem stoleAnd put it in his pocket– QUEEN No more! HAMLET A king of shreds and patches– [Enter Ghost.] Save me and hover o’er me with your wings,You heavenly guards!–What would your graciousfigure? QUEEN Alas, he’s mad. HAMLETDo you not come your tardy son to chide,That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go byTh’ important acting of your dread command?O, say! GHOST Do not forget. This visitationIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.But look, amazement on thy mother sits.O, step between her and her fighting soul.Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.Speak to her, Hamlet. HAMLET How is it with you, lady? QUEEN Alas, how is ‘t with you,That you do bend your eye on vacancyAnd with th’ incorporal air do hold discourse?Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,And, as the sleeping soldiers in th’ alarm,Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,Upon the heat and flame of thy distemperSprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look? HAMLETOn him, on him! Look you how pale he glares.His form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,Would make them capable. [To the Ghost.] Do notlook upon me,Lest with this piteous action you convertMy stern effects. Then what I have to doWill want true color–tears perchance for blood. QUEEN To whom do you speak this? HAMLET Do you see nothing there? QUEENNothing at all; yet all that is I see. HAMLET Nor did you nothing hear? QUEEN No, nothing but ourselves. HAMLETWhy, look you there, look how it steals away!My father, in his habit as he lived!Look where he goes even now out at the portal![Ghost exits.] QUEENThis is the very coinage of your brain.This bodiless creation ecstasyIs very cunning in. HAMLET Ecstasy?My pulse as yours doth temperately keep timeAnd makes as healthful music. It is not madnessThat I have uttered. Bring me to the test,And I the matter will reword, which madnessWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,Lay not that flattering unction to your soulThat not your trespass but my madness speaks.It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,Repent what’s past, avoid what is to come,And do not spread the compost on the weedsTo make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue,For, in the fatness of these pursy times,Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good. QUEENO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain! HAMLETO, throw away the worser part of it,And live the purer with the other half!Good night. But go not to my uncle’s bed.Assume a virtue if you have it not.That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,That to the use of actions fair and goodHe likewise gives a frock or liveryThat aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,And that shall lend a kind of easinessTo the next abstinence, the next more easy;For use almost can change the stamp of natureAnd either … the devil or throw him outWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night,And, when you are desirous to be blest,I’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord[Pointing to Polonius.]I do repent; but heaven hath pleased it soTo punish me with this and this with me,That I must be their scourge and minister.I will bestow him and will answer wellThe death I gave him. So, again, good night.I must be cruel only to be kind.This bad begins, and worse remains behind.One word more, good lady. QUEEN What shall I do? HAMLETNot this by no means that I bid you do:Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed,Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,And let him, for a pair of reechy kissesOr paddling in your neck with his damned fingers,Make you to ravel all this matter outThat I essentially am not in madness,But mad in craft. ‘Twere good you let him know,For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?No, in despite of sense and secrecy,Unpeg the basket on the house’s top,Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,To try conclusions, in the basket creepAnd break your own neck down. QUEENBe thou assured, if words be made of breathAnd breath of life, I have no life to breatheWhat thou hast said to me. HAMLETI must to England, you know that. QUEEN Alack,I had forgot! ‘Tis so concluded on. HAMLETThere’s letters sealed; and my two schoolfellows,Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged,They bear the mandate; they must sweep my wayAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work,For ‘tis the sport to have the enginerHoist with his own petard; and ‘t shall go hardBut I will delve one yard below their minesAnd blow them at the moon. O, ‘tis most sweetWhen in one line two crafts directly meet.This man shall set me packing.I’ll lug the guts into the neighbor room.Mother, good night indeed. This counselorIs now most still, most secret, and most grave,Who was in life a foolish prating knave.–Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.–Good night, mother.[They exit, Hamlet tugging in Polonius.] ACT 4&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Scene 1&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz andGuildenstern.] KINGThere’s matter in these sighs; these profound heavesYou must translate; ‘tis fit we understand them.Where is your son? QUEENBestow this place on us a little while.[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen tonight! KING What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet? QUEENMad as the sea and wind when both contendWhich is the mightier. In his lawless fit,Behind the arras hearing something stir,Whips out his rapier, cries “A rat, a rat,”And in this brainish apprehension killsThe unseen good old man. KING O heavy deed!It had been so with us, had we been there.His liberty is full of threats to all–To you yourself, to us, to everyone.Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?It will be laid to us, whose providenceShould have kept short, restrained, and out of hauntThis mad young man. But so much was our love,We would not understand what was most fit,But, like the owner of a foul disease,To keep it from divulging, let it feedEven on the pith of life. Where is he gone? QUEENTo draw apart the body he hath killed,O’er whom his very madness, like some oreAmong a mineral of metals base,Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done. KING O Gertrude, come away!The sun no sooner shall the mountains touchBut we will ship him hence; and this vile deedWe must with all our majesty and skillBoth countenance and excuse.–Ho, Guildenstern! [Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.] Friends both, go join you with some further aid.Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,And from his mother’s closet hath he dragged him.Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the bodyInto the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friendsAnd let them know both what we mean to doAnd what’s untimely done. …Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter,As level as the cannon to his blankTransports his poisoned shot, may miss our nameAnd hit the woundless air. O, come away!My soul is full of discord and dismay.[They exit.] Scene 2&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter Hamlet.] HAMLET Safely stowed. GENTLEMEN, [within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet! HAMLET But soft, what noise? Who calls on Hamlet?O, here they come. [Enter Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.] ROSENCRANTZWhat have you done, my lord, with the dead body? HAMLETCompounded it with dust, whereto ‘tis kin. ROSENCRANTZTell us where ‘tis, that we may take it thenceAnd bear it to the chapel. HAMLET Do not believe it. ROSENCRANTZ Believe what? HAMLET That I can keep your counsel and not mineown. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge, whatreplication should be made by the son of a king? ROSENCRANTZ Take you me for a sponge, my lord? HAMLET Ay, sir, that soaks up the King’s countenance,his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do theKing best service in the end. He keeps them like anape an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed,to be last swallowed. When he needs what you havegleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, youshall be dry again. ROSENCRANTZ I understand you not, my lord. HAMLET I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in afoolish ear. ROSENCRANTZ My lord, you must tell us where thebody is and go with us to the King. HAMLET The body is with the King, but the King is notwith the body. The King is a thing– GUILDENSTERN A “thing,” my lord? HAMLET Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, andall after![They exit.] Scene 3&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter King and two or three.] KINGI have sent to seek him and to find the body.How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!Yet must not we put the strong law on him.He’s loved of the distracted multitude,Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;And, where ‘tis so, th’ offender’s scourge is weighed,But never the offense. To bear all smooth and even,This sudden sending him away must seemDeliberate pause. Diseases desperate grownBy desperate appliance are relievedOr not at all. [Enter Rosencrantz.] How now, what hath befallen? ROSENCRANTZWhere the dead body is bestowed, my lord,We cannot get from him. KING But where is he? ROSENCRANTZWithout, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure. KINGBring him before us. ROSENCRANTZ Ho! Bring in the lord. [They enter with Hamlet.] KING Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius? HAMLET At supper. KING At supper where? HAMLET Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. Acertain convocation of politic worms are e’en athim. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. Wefat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselvesfor maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar isbut variable service–two dishes but to one table.That’s the end. KING Alas, alas! HAMLET A man may fish with the worm that hath eatof a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of thatworm. KING What dost thou mean by this? HAMLET Nothing but to show you how a king may go aprogress through the guts of a beggar. KING Where is Polonius? HAMLET In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messengerfind him not there, seek him i’ th’ otherplace yourself. But if, indeed, you find him notwithin this month, you shall nose him as you go upthe stairs into the lobby. KING, [to Attendants.] Go, seek him there. HAMLET He will stay till you come. [Attendants exit.] KINGHamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety(Which we do tender, as we dearly grieveFor that which thou hast done) must send theehenceWith fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.The bark is ready, and the wind at help,Th’ associates tend, and everything is bentFor England. HAMLET For England? KING Ay, Hamlet. HAMLET Good. KINGSo is it, if thou knew’st our purposes. HAMLETI see a cherub that sees them. But come, forEngland.Farewell, dear mother. KING Thy loving father, Hamlet. HAMLETMy mother. Father and mother is man and wife,Man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.–Come, for England. [He exits.] KINGFollow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.Delay it not.

CAPTAIN Against some part of Poland. HAMLET Who commands them, sir? CAPTAINThe nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras. HAMLETGoes it against the main of Poland, sir,Or for some frontier? CAPTAINTruly to speak, and with no addition,We go to gain a little patch of groundThat hath in it no profit but the name.To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;Nor will it yield to Norway or the PoleA ranker rate, should it be sold in fee. HAMLETWhy, then, the Polack never will defend it. CAPTAINYes, it is already garrisoned. HAMLETTwo thousand souls and twenty thousand ducatsWill not debate the question of this straw.This is th’ impostume of much wealth and peace,That inward breaks and shows no cause withoutWhy the man dies.–I humbly thank you, sir. CAPTAIN God be wi’ you, sir. [He exits.] ROSENCRANTZ Will ‘t please you go, my lord? HAMLETI’ll be with you straight. Go a little before.[All but Hamlet exit.]How all occasions do inform against meAnd spur my dull revenge. What is a manIf his chief good and market of his timeBe but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.Sure He that made us with such large discourse,Looking before and after, gave us notThat capability and godlike reasonTo fust in us unused. Now whether it beBestial oblivion or some craven scrupleOf thinking too precisely on th’ event(A thought which, quartered, hath but one partwisdomAnd ever three parts coward), I do not knowWhy yet I live to say “This thing’s to do,”Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and meansTo do ‘t. Examples gross as Earth exhort me:Witness this army of such mass and charge,Led by a delicate and tender prince,Whose spirit with divine ambition puffedMakes mouths at the invisible event,Exposing what is mortal and unsureTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be greatIs not to stir without great argument,But greatly to find quarrel in a strawWhen honor’s at the stake. How stand I, then,That have a father killed, a mother stained,Excitements of my reason and my blood,And let all sleep, while to my shame I seeThe imminent death of twenty thousand menThat for a fantasy and trick of fameGo to their graves like beds, fight for a plotWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,Which is not tomb enough and continentTo hide the slain? O, from this time forthMy thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth![He exits.] Scene 5&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.] QUEEN I will not speak with her. GENTLEMAN She is importunate,Indeed distract; her mood will needs be pitied. QUEEN What would she have? GENTLEMANShe speaks much of her father, says she hearsThere’s tricks i’ th’ world, and hems, and beats herheart,Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubtThat carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,Yet the unshaped use of it doth moveThe hearers to collection. They aim at itAnd botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yieldthem,Indeed would make one think there might bethought,Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily. HORATIO‘Twere good she were spoken with, for she maystrewDangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds. QUEEN Let her come in. [Gentleman exits.][Aside.] To my sick soul (as sin’s true nature is),Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.So full of artless jealousy is guilt,It spills itself in fearing to be spilt. [Enter Ophelia distracted.] OPHELIAWhere is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark? QUEEN How now, Ophelia? OPHELIA [sings] How should I your true love know From another one? By his cockle hat and staff And his sandal shoon. QUEENAlas, sweet lady, what imports this song? OPHELIA Say you? Nay, pray you, mark.[Sings.] He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone; At his head a grass-green turf, At his heels a stone.Oh, ho! QUEEN Nay, but Ophelia– OPHELIA Pray you, mark.[Sings.] White his shroud as the mountain snow– [Enter King.] QUEEN Alas, look here, my lord. OPHELIA [sings] Larded all with sweet flowers; Which bewept to the ground did not go With true-love showers. KING How do you, pretty lady? OPHELIA Well, God dild you. They say the owl was abaker’s daughter. Lord, we know what we are butknow not what we may be. God be at your table. KING Conceit upon her father. OPHELIA Pray let’s have no words of this, but whenthey ask you what it means, say you this:[Sings.] Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day, All in the morning betime, And I a maid at your window, To be your Valentine. Then up he rose and donned his clothes And dupped the chamber door, Let in the maid, that out a maid Never departed more. KING Pretty Ophelia– OPHELIAIndeed, without an oath, I’ll make an end on ‘t:[Sings.] By Gis and by Saint Charity, Alack and fie for shame, Young men will do ‘t, if they come to ‘t; By Cock, they are to blame. Quoth she “Before you tumbled me, You promised me to wed.”He answers: “So would I ‘a done, by yonder sun, An thou hadst not come to my bed.” KING How long hath she been thus? OPHELIA I hope all will be well. We must be patient,but I cannot choose but weep to think they wouldlay him i’ th’ cold ground. My brother shall know ofit. And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come,my coach! Good night, ladies, good night, sweetladies, good night, good night. [She exits.] KINGFollow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.[Horatio exits.]O, this is the poison of deep grief. It springsAll from her father’s death, and now behold!O Gertrude, Gertrude,When sorrows come, they come not single spies,But in battalions: first, her father slain;Next, your son gone, and he most violent authorOf his own just remove; the people muddied,Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts andwhispersFor good Polonius’ death, and we have done butgreenlyIn hugger-mugger to inter him; poor OpheliaDivided from herself and her fair judgment,Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;Last, and as much containing as all these,Her brother is in secret come from France,Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,And wants not buzzers to infect his earWith pestilent speeches of his father’s death,Wherein necessity, of matter beggared,Will nothing stick our person to arraignIn ear and ear. O, my dear Gertrude, this,Like to a murd’ring piece, in many placesGives me superfluous death.[A noise within.] QUEEN Alack, what noise is this? KING Attend!Where is my Switzers? Let them guard the door. [Enter a Messenger.] What is the matter? MESSENGER Save yourself, my lord.The ocean, overpeering of his list,Eats not the flats with more impiteous hasteThan young Laertes, in a riotous head,O’erbears your officers. The rabble call him “lord,”And, as the world were now but to begin,Antiquity forgot, custom not known,The ratifiers and props of every word,They cry “Choose we, Laertes shall be king!”Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,“Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!”[A noise within.] QUEENHow cheerfully on the false trail they cry.O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs! KING The doors are broke. [Enter Laertes with others.] LAERTESWhere is this king?–Sirs, stand you all without. ALL No, let’s come in! LAERTES I pray you, give me leave. ALL We will, we will. LAERTESI thank you. Keep the door. [Followers exit.] O, thouvile king,Give me my father! QUEEN Calmly, good Laertes. LAERTESThat drop of blood that’s calm proclaims mebastard,Cries “cuckold” to my father, brands the harlotEven here between the chaste unsmirched browOf my true mother. KING What is the cause, Laertes,That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?–Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.There’s such divinity doth hedge a kingThat treason can but peep to what it would,Acts little of his will.–Tell me, Laertes,Why thou art thus incensed.–Let him go,Gertrude.–Speak, man. LAERTES Where is my father? KING Dead. QUEENBut not by him. KING Let him demand his fill. LAERTESHow came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with.To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!I dare damnation. To this point I stand,That both the worlds I give to negligence,Let come what comes, only I’ll be revengedMost throughly for my father. KING Who shall stay you? LAERTES My will, not all the world.And for my means, I’ll husband them so wellThey shall go far with little. KING Good Laertes,If you desire to know the certaintyOf your dear father, is ‘t writ in your revengeThat, swoopstake, you will draw both friend andfoe,Winner and loser? LAERTES None but his enemies. KING Will you know them, then? LAERTESTo his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my armsAnd, like the kind life-rend’ring pelican,Repast them with my blood. KING Why, now you speakLike a good child and a true gentleman.That I am guiltless of your father’s deathAnd am most sensibly in grief for it,It shall as level to your judgment ‘pearAs day does to your eye. [A noise within:] “Let her come in!” LAERTES How now, what noise is that? [Enter Ophelia.] O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times saltBurn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!By heaven, thy madness shall be paid with weightTill our scale turn the beam! O rose of May,Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!O heavens, is ‘t possible a young maid’s witsShould be as mortal as an old man’s life?Nature is fine in love, and, where ‘tis fine,It sends some precious instance of itselfAfter the thing it loves. OPHELIA [sings] They bore him barefaced on the bier, Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny, And in his grave rained many a tear.Fare you well, my dove. LAERTESHadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge,It could not move thus. OPHELIA You must sing “A-down a-down”–and you“Call him a-down-a.”–O, how the wheel becomesit! It is the false steward that stole his master’sdaughter. LAERTES This nothing’s more than matter. OPHELIA There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.Pray you, love, remember. And there is pansies,that’s for thoughts. LAERTES A document in madness: thoughts and remembrancefitted. OPHELIA There’s fennel for you, and columbines.There’s rue for you, and here’s some for me; wemay call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. You must wearyour rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I wouldgive you some violets, but they withered all whenmy father died. They say he made a good end.[Sings.] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy. LAERTESThought and afflictions, passion, hell itselfShe turns to favor and to prettiness. OPHELIA [sings] And will he not come again? And will he not come again? No, no, he is dead. Go to thy deathbed. He never will come again. His beard was as white as snow, All flaxen was his poll. He is gone, he is gone, And we cast away moan. God &#39;a mercy on his soul. And of all Christians’ souls, I pray God. God be wi’you. [She exits.] LAERTES Do you see this, O God? KINGLaertes, I must commune with your grief,Or you deny me right. Go but apart,Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,And they shall hear and judge ‘twixt you and me.If by direct or by collateral handThey find us touched, we will our kingdom give,Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,To you in satisfaction; but if not,Be you content to lend your patience to us,And we shall jointly labor with your soulTo give it due content. LAERTES Let this be so.His means of death, his obscure funeral(No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones,No noble rite nor formal ostentation)Cry to be heard, as ‘twere from heaven to earth,That I must call ‘t in question. KING So you shall,And where th’ offense is, let the great ax fall.I pray you, go with me.[They exit.] Scene 6&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter Horatio and others.] HORATIO What are they that would speak with me? GENTLEMAN Seafaring men, sir. They say they haveletters for you. HORATIO Let them come in. [Gentleman exits.] I do notknow from what part of the world I should begreeted, if not from Lord Hamlet. [Enter Sailors.] SAILOR God bless you, sir. HORATIO Let Him bless thee too. SAILOR He shall, sir, an ‘t please Him. There’s a letterfor you, sir. It came from th’ ambassador that wasbound for England–if your name be Horatio, as Iam let to know it is. [He hands Horatio a letter.] HORATIO [reads the letter] Horatio, when thou shalt haveoverlooked this, give these fellows some means to theKing. They have letters for him. Ere we were two daysold at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gaveus chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put ona compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them.On the instant, they got clear of our ship; so I alonebecame their prisoner. They have dealt with me likethieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am todo a good turn for them. Let the King have the lettersI have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speedas thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak inthine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much toolight for the bore of the matter. These good fellowswill bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildensternhold their course for England; of them I havemuch to tell thee. Farewell.He that thou knowest thine,Hamlet.Come, I will give you way for these your lettersAnd do ‘t the speedier that you may direct meTo him from whom you brought them.[They exit.] Scene 7&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter King and Laertes.] KINGNow must your conscience my acquittance seal,And you must put me in your heart for friend,Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,That he which hath your noble father slainPursued my life. LAERTES It well appears. But tell meWhy you proceeded not against these feats,So criminal and so capital in nature,As by your safety, greatness, wisdom, all things else,You mainly were stirred up. KING O, for two special reasons,Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,But yet to me they’re strong. The Queen his motherLives almost by his looks, and for myself(My virtue or my plague, be it either which),She is so conjunctive to my life and soulThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,I could not but by her. The other motiveWhy to a public count I might not goIs the great love the general gender bear him,Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,Work like the spring that turneth wood to stone,Convert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows,Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind,Would have reverted to my bow again,But not where I have aimed them. LAERTESAnd so have I a noble father lost,A sister driven into desp’rate terms,Whose worth, if praises may go back again,Stood challenger on mount of all the ageFor her perfections. But my revenge will come. KINGBreak not your sleeps for that. You must not thinkThat we are made of stuff so flat and dullThat we can let our beard be shook with dangerAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.I loved your father, and we love ourself,And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine– [Enter a Messenger with letters.] How now? What news? MESSENGER Letters, my lord, fromHamlet.These to your Majesty, this to the Queen. KING From Hamlet? Who brought them? MESSENGERSailors, my lord, they say. I saw them not.They were given me by Claudio. He received themOf him that brought them. KING Laertes, you shall hearthem.–Leave us. [Messenger exits.][Reads.] High and mighty, you shall know I am setnaked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave tosee your kingly eyes, when I shall (first asking yourpardon) thereunto recount the occasion of my suddenand more strange return. Hamlet.What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?Or is it some abuse and no such thing? LAERTES Know you the hand? KING ‘Tis Hamlet’s character. “Naked”–And in a postscript here, he says “alone.”Can you advise me? LAERTESI am lost in it, my lord. But let him come.It warms the very sickness in my heartThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth“Thus didst thou.” KING If it be so, Laertes(As how should it be so? how otherwise?),Will you be ruled by me? LAERTES Ay, my lord,So you will not o’errule me to a peace. KINGTo thine own peace. If he be now returned,As checking at his voyage, and that he meansNo more to undertake it, I will work himTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,Under the which he shall not choose but fall;And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,But even his mother shall uncharge the practiceAnd call it accident. LAERTES My lord, I will be ruled,The rather if you could devise it soThat I might be the organ. KING It falls right.You have been talked of since your travel much,And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a qualityWherein they say you shine. Your sum of partsDid not together pluck such envy from himAs did that one, and that, in my regard,Of the unworthiest siege. LAERTES What part is that, my lord? KINGA very ribbon in the cap of youth–Yet needful too, for youth no less becomesThe light and careless livery that it wearsThan settled age his sables and his weeds,Importing health and graveness. Two months sinceHere was a gentleman of Normandy.I have seen myself, and served against, the French,And they can well on horseback, but this gallantHad witchcraft in ‘t. He grew unto his seat,And to such wondrous doing brought his horseAs had he been encorpsed and demi-naturedWith the brave beast. So far he topped my thoughtThat I in forgery of shapes and tricksCome short of what he did. LAERTES A Norman was ‘t? KING A Norman. LAERTESUpon my life, Lamord. KING The very same. LAERTESI know him well. He is the brooch indeedAnd gem of all the nation. KING He made confession of youAnd gave you such a masterly reportFor art and exercise in your defense,And for your rapier most especial,That he cried out ‘twould be a sight indeedIf one could match you. The ‘scrimers of theirnationHe swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,If you opposed them. Sir, this report of hisDid Hamlet so envenom with his envyThat he could nothing do but wish and begYour sudden coming-o’er, to play with you.Now out of this– LAERTES What out of this, my lord? KINGLaertes, was your father dear to you?Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,A face without a heart? LAERTES Why ask you this? KINGNot that I think you did not love your father,But that I know love is begun by timeAnd that I see, in passages of proof,Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.There lives within the very flame of loveA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,And nothing is at a like goodness still;For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,Dies in his own too-much. That we would doWe should do when we would; for this “would”changesAnd hath abatements and delays as manyAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;And then this “should” is like a spendthrift sigh,That hurts by easing. But to the quick of th’ ulcer:Hamlet comes back; what would you undertakeTo show yourself indeed your father’s sonMore than in words? LAERTES To cut his throat i’ th’ church. KINGNo place indeed should murder sanctuarize;Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.Hamlet, returned, shall know you are come home.We’ll put on those shall praise your excellenceAnd set a double varnish on the fameThe Frenchman gave you; bring you, in fine,togetherAnd wager on your heads. He, being remiss,Most generous, and free from all contriving,Will not peruse the foils, so that with ease,Or with a little shuffling, you may chooseA sword unbated, and in a pass of practiceRequite him for your father. LAERTES I will do ‘t,And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.I bought an unction of a mountebankSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,Collected from all simples that have virtueUnder the moon, can save the thing from deathThat is but scratched withal. I’ll touch my pointWith this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,It may be death. KING Let’s further think of this,Weigh what convenience both of time and meansMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,And that our drift look through our badperformance,‘Twere better not assayed. Therefore this projectShould have a back or second that might holdIf this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings–I ha ‘t!When in your motion you are hot and dry(As make your bouts more violent to that end)And that he calls for drink, I’ll have preparedhimA chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,If he by chance escape your venomed stuck,Our purpose may hold there.–But stay, whatnoise? [Enter Queen.] QUEENOne woe doth tread upon another’s heel,So fast they follow. Your sister’s drowned, Laertes. LAERTES Drowned? O, where? QUEENThere is a willow grows askant the brookThat shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.Therewith fantastic garlands did she makeOf crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,But our cold maids do “dead men’s fingers” callthem.There on the pendant boughs her coronet weedsClamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,When down her weedy trophies and herselfFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,Which time she chanted snatches of old lauds,As one incapable of her own distressOr like a creature native and enduedUnto that element. But long it could not beTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious layTo muddy death. LAERTES Alas, then she is drowned. QUEEN Drowned, drowned. LAERTESToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,And therefore I forbid my tears. But yetIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,The woman will be out.–Adieu, my lord.I have a speech o’ fire that fain would blaze,But that this folly drowns it. [He exits.] KING Let’s follow, Gertrude.How much I had to do to calm his rage!Now fear I this will give it start again.Therefore, let’s follow.[They exit.] ACT 5&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Scene 1&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter Gravedigger and Another.] GRAVEDIGGER Is she to be buried in Christian burial,when she willfully seeks her own salvation? OTHER I tell thee she is. Therefore make her gravestraight. The crowner hath sat on her and finds itChristian burial. GRAVEDIGGER How can that be, unless she drownedherself in her own defense? OTHER Why, ‘tis found so. GRAVEDIGGER It must be se offendendo; it cannot beelse. For here lies the point: if I drown myselfwittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath threebranches–it is to act, to do, to perform. Argal, shedrowned herself wittingly. OTHER Nay, but hear you, goodman delver– GRAVEDIGGER Give me leave. Here lies the water;good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go tothis water and drown himself, it is (will he, nill he)he goes; mark you that. But if the water come to himand drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, hethat is not guilty of his own death shortens not hisown life. OTHER But is this law? GRAVEDIGGER Ay, marry, is ‘t–crowner’s ‘quest law. OTHER Will you ha’ the truth on ‘t? If this had not beena gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’Christian burial. GRAVEDIGGER Why, there thou sayst. And the morepity that great folk should have count’nance in thisworld to drown or hang themselves more thantheir even-Christian. Come, my spade. There is noancient gentlemen but gard’ners, ditchers, andgrave-makers. They hold up Adam’s profession. OTHER Was he a gentleman? GRAVEDIGGER He was the first that ever bore arms. OTHER Why, he had none. GRAVEDIGGER What, art a heathen? How dost thouunderstand the scripture? The scripture says Adamdigged. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put anotherquestion to thee. If thou answerest me not to thepurpose, confess thyself– OTHER Go to! GRAVEDIGGER What is he that builds stronger thaneither the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? OTHER The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives athousand tenants. GRAVEDIGGER I like thy wit well, in good faith. Thegallows does well. But how does it well? It doeswell to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say thegallows is built stronger than the church. Argal, thegallows may do well to thee. To ‘t again, come. OTHER “Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright,or a carpenter?” GRAVEDIGGER Ay, tell me that, and unyoke. OTHER Marry, now I can tell. GRAVEDIGGER To ‘t. OTHER Mass, I cannot tell. [Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.] GRAVEDIGGER Cudgel thy brains no more about it,for your dull ass will not mend his pace withbeating. And, when you are asked this questionnext, say “a grave-maker.” The houses he makeslasts till doomsday. Go, get thee in, and fetch me astoup of liquor.[The Other Man exitsand the Gravedigger digs and sings.] In youth when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet To contract–O–the time for–a–my behove, O, methought there–a–was nothing–a–meet. HAMLET Has this fellow no feeling of his business? Hesings in grave-making. HORATIO Custom hath made it in him a property ofeasiness. HAMLET ‘Tis e’en so. The hand of little employmenthath the daintier sense. GRAVEDIGGER [sings] But age with his stealing steps Hath clawed me in his clutch, And hath shipped me into the land, As if I had never been such.[He digs up a skull.] HAMLET That skull had a tongue in it and could singonce. How the knave jowls it to the ground as if‘twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder!This might be the pate of a politician which this assnow o’erreaches, one that would circumvent God,might it not? HORATIO It might, my lord. HAMLET Or of a courtier, which could say “Goodmorrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, sweet lord?”This might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised myLord Such-a-one’s horse when he went to beg it,might it not? HORATIO Ay, my lord. HAMLET Why, e’en so. And now my Lady Worm’s,chapless and knocked about the mazard with asexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we hadthe trick to see ‘t. Did these bones cost no more thebreeding but to play at loggets with them? Mineache to think on ‘t. GRAVEDIGGER [sings] A pickax and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet, O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.[He digs up more skulls.] HAMLET There’s another. Why may not that be theskull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, hisquillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Whydoes he suffer this mad knave now to knock himabout the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tellhim of his action of battery? Hum, this fellow mightbe in ‘s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and therecovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate fullof fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no moreof his purchases, and double ones too, than thelength and breadth of a pair of indentures? The veryconveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box,and must th’ inheritor himself have no more, ha? HORATIO Not a jot more, my lord. HAMLET Is not parchment made of sheepskins? HORATIO Ay, my lord, and of calves’ skins too. HAMLET They are sheep and calves which seek outassurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.–Whose grave’s this, sirrah? GRAVEDIGGER Mine, sir.[Sings.] O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet. HAMLET I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in ‘t. GRAVEDIGGER You lie out on ‘t, sir, and therefore ‘tisnot yours. For my part, I do not lie in ‘t, yet it ismine. HAMLET Thou dost lie in ‘t, to be in ‘t and say it is thine.‘Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thouliest. GRAVEDIGGER ‘Tis a quick lie, sir; ‘twill away againfrom me to you. HAMLET What man dost thou dig it for? GRAVEDIGGER For no man, sir. HAMLET What woman then? GRAVEDIGGER For none, neither. HAMLET Who is to be buried in ‘t? GRAVEDIGGER One that was a woman, sir, but, resther soul, she’s dead. HAMLET How absolute the knave is! We must speak bythe card, or equivocation will undo us. By theLord, Horatio, this three years I have took note ofit: the age is grown so picked that the toe of thepeasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, hegalls his kibe.–How long hast thou beengrave-maker? GRAVEDIGGER Of all the days i’ th’ year, I came to ‘tthat day that our last King Hamlet overcameFortinbras. HAMLET How long is that since? GRAVEDIGGER Cannot you tell that? Every fool cantell that. It was that very day that young Hamletwas born–he that is mad, and sent into England. HAMLET Ay, marry, why was he sent into England? GRAVEDIGGER Why, because he was mad. He shallrecover his wits there. Or if he do not, ‘tis no greatmatter there. HAMLET Why? GRAVEDIGGER ‘Twill not be seen in him there. Therethe men are as mad as he. HAMLET How came he mad? GRAVEDIGGER Very strangely, they say. HAMLET How “strangely”? GRAVEDIGGER Faith, e’en with losing his wits. HAMLET Upon what ground? GRAVEDIGGER Why, here in Denmark. I have beensexton here, man and boy, thirty years. HAMLET How long will a man lie i’ th’ earth ere he rot? GRAVEDIGGER Faith, if he be not rotten before he die(as we have many pocky corses nowadays that willscarce hold the laying in), he will last you someeight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nineyear. HAMLET Why he more than another? GRAVEDIGGER Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with histrade that he will keep out water a great while; andyour water is a sore decayer of your whoreson deadbody. Here’s a skull now hath lien you i’ th’ earththree-and-twenty years. HAMLET Whose was it? GRAVEDIGGER A whoreson mad fellow’s it was.Whose do you think it was? HAMLET Nay, I know not. GRAVEDIGGER A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!He poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.This same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick’s skull, theKing’s jester. HAMLET This? GRAVEDIGGER E’en that. HAMLET, [taking the skull] Let me see. Alas, poorYorick! I knew him, Horatio–a fellow of infinitejest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on hisback a thousand times, and now how abhorred inmy imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hungthose lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.Where be your gibes now? your gambols? yoursongs? your flashes of merriment that were wont toset the table on a roar? Not one now to mock yourown grinning? Quite chapfallen? Now get you to mylady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inchthick, to this favor she must come. Make her laughat that.–Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing. HORATIO What’s that, my lord? HAMLET Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ thisfashion i’ th’ earth? HORATIO E’en so. HAMLET And smelt so? Pah! [He puts the skull down.] HORATIO E’en so, my lord. HAMLET To what base uses we may return, Horatio!Why may not imagination trace the noble dust ofAlexander till he find it stopping a bunghole? HORATIO ‘Twere to consider too curiously to considerso. HAMLET No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither,with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it, asthus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexanderreturneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earthwe make loam; and why of that loam whereto hewas converted might they not stop a beer barrel?Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.O, that that earth which kept the world in aweShould patch a wall t’ expel the winter’s flaw! [Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords attendant, and thecorpse of Ophelia, with a Doctor of Divinity.] But soft, but soft awhile! Here comes the King,The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?And with such maimed rites? This doth betokenThe corse they follow did with desp’rate handFordo its own life. ‘Twas of some estate.Couch we awhile and mark. [They step aside.] LAERTES What ceremony else? HAMLET That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark. LAERTES What ceremony else? DOCTORHer obsequies have been as far enlargedAs we have warranty. Her death was doubtful,And, but that great command o’ersways the order,She should in ground unsanctified been lodgedTill the last trumpet. For charitable prayersShards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown onher.Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants,Her maiden strewments, and the bringing homeOf bell and burial. LAERTESMust there no more be done? DOCTOR No more be done.We should profane the service of the deadTo sing a requiem and such rest to herAs to peace-parted souls. LAERTES Lay her i’ th’ earth,And from her fair and unpolluted fleshMay violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,A minist’ring angel shall my sister beWhen thou liest howling. HAMLET, [to Horatio] What, the fair Ophelia? QUEEN Sweets to the sweet, farewell![She scatters flowers.]I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;I thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid,And not have strewed thy grave. LAERTES O, treble woeFall ten times treble on that cursed headWhose wicked deed thy most ingenious senseDeprived thee of!–Hold off the earth awhile,Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.[Leaps in the grave.]Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,Till of this flat a mountain you have madeT’ o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish headOf blue Olympus. HAMLET, [advancing]What is he whose griefBears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrowConjures the wand’ring stars and makes them standLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,Hamlet the Dane. LAERTES, [coming out of the grave]The devil take thy soul! HAMLET Thou pray’st not well. [They grapple.]I prithee take thy fingers from my throat,For though I am not splenitive and rash,Yet have I in me something dangerous,Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand. KING Pluck them asunder. QUEEN Hamlet! Hamlet! ALL Gentlemen! HORATIO Good my lord, be quiet.[Hamlet and Laertes are separated.] HAMLETWhy, I will fight with him upon this themeUntil my eyelids will no longer wag! QUEEN O my son, what theme? HAMLETI loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothersCould not with all their quantity of loveMake up my sum. What wilt thou do for her? KING O, he is mad, Laertes! QUEEN For love of God, forbear him. HAMLET ‘Swounds, show me what thou ‘t do.Woo’t weep, woo’t fight, woo’t fast, woo’t tearthyself,Woo’t drink up eisel, eat a crocodile?I’ll do ‘t. Dost thou come here to whine?To outface me with leaping in her grave?Be buried quick with her, and so will I.And if thou prate of mountains, let them throwMillions of acres on us, till our ground,Singeing his pate against the burning zone,Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou ‘lt mouth,I’ll rant as well as thou. QUEEN This is mere madness;And thus awhile the fit will work on him.Anon, as patient as the female doveWhen that her golden couplets are disclosed,His silence will sit drooping. HAMLET Hear you, sir,What is the reason that you use me thus?I loved you ever. But it is no matter.Let Hercules himself do what he may,The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.[Hamlet exits.] KINGI pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.[Horatio exits.][To Laertes.] Strengthen your patience in our lastnight’s speech.We’ll put the matter to the present push.–Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.–This grave shall have a living monument.An hour of quiet thereby shall we see.Till then in patience our proceeding be.[They exit.] Scene 2&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[Enter Hamlet and Horatio.] HAMLETSo much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.You do remember all the circumstance? HORATIO Remember it, my lord! HAMLETSir, in my heart there was a kind of fightingThat would not let me sleep. Methought I layWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly–And praised be rashness for it; let us know,Our indiscretion sometime serves us wellWhen our deep plots do pall; and that should learnusThere’s a divinity that shapes our ends,Rough-hew them how we will– HORATIO That is mostcertain. HAMLET Up from my cabin,My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the darkGroped I to find out them; had my desire,Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrewTo mine own room again, making so bold(My fears forgetting manners) to unfoldTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,A royal knavery–an exact command,Larded with many several sorts of reasonsImporting Denmark’s health and England’s too,With–ho!–such bugs and goblins in my life,That on the supervise, no leisure bated,No, not to stay the grinding of the ax,My head should be struck off. HORATIO Is ‘t possible? HAMLETHere’s the commission. Read it at more leisure.[Handing him a paper.]But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed? HORATIO I beseech you. HAMLETBeing thus benetted round with villainies,Or I could make a prologue to my brains,They had begun the play. I sat me down,Devised a new commission, wrote it fair–I once did hold it, as our statists do,A baseness to write fair, and labored muchHow to forget that learning; but, sir, nowIt did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou knowTh’ effect of what I wrote? HORATIO Ay, good my lord. HAMLETAn earnest conjuration from the King,As England was his faithful tributary,As love between them like the palm might flourish,As peace should still her wheaten garland wearAnd stand a comma ‘tween their amities,And many suchlike ases of great charge,That, on the view and knowing of these contents,Without debatement further, more or less,He should those bearers put to sudden death,Not shriving time allowed. HORATIO How was this sealed? HAMLETWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.I had my father’s signet in my purse,Which was the model of that Danish seal;Folded the writ up in the form of th’ other,Subscribed it, gave ‘t th’ impression, placed itsafely,The changeling never known. Now, the next dayWas our sea-fight; and what to this was sequentThou knowest already. HORATIOSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ‘t. HAMLETWhy, man, they did make love to this employment.They are not near my conscience. Their defeatDoes by their own insinuation grow.‘Tis dangerous when the baser nature comesBetween the pass and fell incensed pointsOf mighty opposites. HORATIO Why, what a king is this! HAMLETDoes it not, think thee, stand me now upon–He that hath killed my king and whored my mother,Popped in between th’ election and my hopes,Thrown out his angle for my proper life,And with such cozenage–is ‘t not perfectconscienceTo quit him with this arm? And is ‘t not to bedamnedTo let this canker of our nature comeIn further evil? HORATIOIt must be shortly known to him from EnglandWhat is the issue of the business there. HAMLETIt will be short. The interim’s mine,And a man’s life’s no more than to say “one.”But I am very sorry, good Horatio,That to Laertes I forgot myself,For by the image of my cause I seeThe portraiture of his. I’ll court his favors.But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put meInto a tow’ring passion. HORATIO Peace, who comes here? [Enter Osric, a courtier.] OSRIC Your Lordship is right welcome back toDenmark. HAMLET I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio.]Dost know this waterfly? HORATIO, [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord. HAMLET, [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious,for ‘tis a vice to know him. He hath muchland, and fertile. Let a beast be lord of beasts and hiscrib shall stand at the king’s mess. ‘Tis a chough,but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt. OSRIC Sweet lord, if your Lordship were at leisure, Ishould impart a thing to you from his Majesty. HAMLET I will receive it, sir, with all diligence ofspirit. Put your bonnet to his right use: ‘tis for thehead. OSRIC I thank your Lordship; it is very hot. HAMLET No, believe me, ‘tis very cold; the wind isnortherly. OSRIC It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed. HAMLET But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot formy complexion. OSRIC Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as‘twere–I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majestybade me signify to you that he has laid a great wageron your head. Sir, this is the matter– HAMLET I beseech you, remember. [He motions toOsric to put on his hat.] OSRIC Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith.Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes–believeme, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellentdifferences, of very soft society and great showing.Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card orcalendar of gentry, for you shall find in him thecontinent of what part a gentleman would see. HAMLET Sir, his definement suffers no perdition inyou, though I know to divide him inventoriallywould dozy th’ arithmetic of memory, and yet butyaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in theverity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of greatarticle, and his infusion of such dearth and rarenessas, to make true diction of him, his semblable is hismirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage,nothing more. OSRIC Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him. HAMLET The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap thegentleman in our more rawer breath? OSRIC Sir? HORATIO Is ‘t not possible to understand in anothertongue? You will to ‘t, sir, really. HAMLET, [to Osric] What imports the nomination ofthis gentleman? OSRIC Of Laertes? HORATIO His purse is empty already; all ‘s golden wordsare spent. HAMLET Of him, sir. OSRIC I know you are not ignorant– HAMLET I would you did, sir. Yet, in faith, if you did, itwould not much approve me. Well, sir? OSRIC You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertesis– HAMLET I dare not confess that, lest I should comparewith him in excellence. But to know a man wellwere to know himself. OSRIC I mean, sir, for his weapon. But in the imputationlaid on him by them, in his meed he’sunfellowed. HAMLET What’s his weapon? OSRIC Rapier and dagger. HAMLET That’s two of his weapons. But, well– OSRIC The King, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbaryhorses, against the which he has impawned, as Itake it, six French rapiers and poniards, with theirassigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of thecarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, veryresponsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, andof very liberal conceit. HAMLET What call you the “carriages”? HORATIO I knew you must be edified by the margentere you had done. OSRIC The carriages, sir, are the hangers. HAMLET The phrase would be more germane to thematter if we could carry a cannon by our sides. Iwould it might be “hangers” till then. But on. SixBarbary horses against six French swords, theirassigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages–that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is thisall “impawned,” as you call it? OSRIC The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozenpasses between yourself and him, he shall notexceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve fornine, and it would come to immediate trial if yourLordship would vouchsafe the answer. HAMLET How if I answer no? OSRIC I mean, my lord, the opposition of your personin trial. HAMLET Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please hisMajesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Letthe foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and theKing hold his purpose, I will win for him, an I can.If not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the oddhits. OSRIC Shall I deliver you e’en so? HAMLET To this effect, sir, after what flourish yournature will. OSRIC I commend my duty to your Lordship. HAMLET Yours. [Osric exits.] He does well to commendit himself. There are no tongues else for ‘sturn. HORATIO This lapwing runs away with the shell on hishead. HAMLET He did comply, sir, with his dug before hesucked it. Thus has he (and many more of the samebreed that I know the drossy age dotes on) only gotthe tune of the time, and, out of an habit ofencounter, a kind of yeasty collection, which carriesthem through and through the most fannedand winnowed opinions; and do but blow them totheir trial, the bubbles are out. [Enter a Lord.] LORD My lord, his Majesty commended him to you byyoung Osric, who brings back to him that youattend him in the hall. He sends to know if yourpleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you willtake longer time. HAMLET I am constant to my purposes. They followthe King’s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine isready now or whensoever, provided I be so able asnow. LORD The King and Queen and all are coming down. HAMLET In happy time. LORD The Queen desires you to use some gentleentertainment to Laertes before you fall to play. HAMLET She well instructs me. [Lord exits.] HORATIO You will lose, my lord. HAMLET I do not think so. Since he went into France, Ihave been in continual practice. I shall win at theodds; but thou wouldst not think how ill all’s hereabout my heart. But it is no matter. HORATIO Nay, good my lord– HAMLET It is but foolery, but it is such a kind ofgaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman. HORATIO If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I willforestall their repair hither and say you are not fit. HAMLET Not a whit. We defy augury. There is aspecial providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it benow, ‘tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will benow; if it be not now, yet it will come. Thereadiness is all. Since no man of aught he leavesknows, what is ‘t to leave betimes? Let be. [A table prepared. Enter Trumpets, Drums, and Officerswith cushions, King, Queen, Osric, and all the state,foils, daggers, flagons of wine, and Laertes.] KINGCome, Hamlet, come and take this hand from me.[He puts Laertes’ hand into Hamlet’s.] HAMLET, [to Laertes]Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;But pardon ‘t as you are a gentleman. This presenceknows,And you must needs have heard, how I am punishedWith a sore distraction. What I have doneThat might your nature, honor, and exceptionRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.Was ‘t Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,Then Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.Who does it, then? His madness. If ‘t be so,Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged;His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.Sir, in this audienceLet my disclaiming from a purposed evilFree me so far in your most generous thoughtsThat I have shot my arrow o’er the houseAnd hurt my brother. LAERTES I am satisfied in nature,Whose motive in this case should stir me mostTo my revenge; but in my terms of honorI stand aloof and will no reconcilementTill by some elder masters of known honorI have a voice and precedent of peaceTo keep my name ungored. But till that timeI do receive your offered love like loveAnd will not wrong it. HAMLET I embrace it freelyAnd will this brothers’ wager frankly play.–Give us the foils. Come on. LAERTES Come, one for me. HAMLETI’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignoranceYour skill shall, like a star i’ th’ darkest night,Stick fiery off indeed. LAERTES You mock me, sir. HAMLET No, by this hand. KINGGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,You know the wager? HAMLET Very well, my lord.Your Grace has laid the odds o’ th’ weaker side. KINGI do not fear it; I have seen you both.But, since he is better, we have therefore odds. LAERTESThis is too heavy. Let me see another. HAMLETThis likes me well. These foils have all a length? OSRIC Ay, my good lord.[Prepare to play.] KINGSet me the stoups of wine upon that table.–If Hamlet give the first or second hitOr quit in answer of the third exchange,Let all the battlements their ordnance fire.The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,And in the cup an union shall he throw,Richer than that which four successive kingsIn Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups,And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,The trumpet to the cannoneer without,The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,“Now the King drinks to Hamlet.” Come, begin.And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.[Trumpets the while.] HAMLET Come on, sir. LAERTES Come, my lord. [They play.] HAMLET One. LAERTES No. HAMLET Judgment! OSRIC A hit, a very palpable hit. LAERTES Well, again. KINGStay, give me drink.–Hamlet, this pearl is thine.Here’s to thy health.[He drinks and then drops the pearl in the cup.][Drum, trumpets, and shot.]Give him the cup. HAMLETI’ll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.Come. [They play.] Another hit. What say you? LAERTESA touch, a touch. I do confess ‘t. KINGOur son shall win. QUEEN He’s fat and scant of breath.–Here, Hamlet, take my napkin; rub thy brows.The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.[She lifts the cup.] HAMLET Good madam. KING Gertrude, do not drink. QUEENI will, my lord; I pray you pardon me. [She drinks.] KING, [aside]It is the poisoned cup. It is too late. HAMLETI dare not drink yet, madam–by and by. QUEEN Come, let me wipe thy face. LAERTES, [to Claudius]My lord, I’ll hit him now. KING I do not think ‘t. LAERTES, [aside]And yet it is almost against my conscience. HAMLETCome, for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.I pray you pass with your best violence.I am afeard you make a wanton of me. LAERTES Say you so? Come on. [Play.] OSRIC Nothing neither way. LAERTES Have at you now![Laertes wounds Hamlet. Then in scuffling they changerapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.] KING Part them. They are incensed. HAMLET Nay, come again.[The Queen falls.] OSRIC Look to the Queen there, ho! HORATIOThey bleed on both sides.–How is it, my lord? OSRIC How is ‘t, Laertes? LAERTESWhy as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.[He falls.]I am justly killed with mine own treachery. HAMLETHow does the Queen? KING She swoons to see them bleed. QUEENNo, no, the drink, the drink! O, my dear Hamlet!The drink, the drink! I am poisoned. [She dies.] HAMLETO villainy! Ho! Let the door be locked. [Osric exits.]Treachery! Seek it out. LAERTESIt is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.No med’cine in the world can do thee good.In thee there is not half an hour’s life.The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,Unbated and envenomed. The foul practiceHath turned itself on me. Lo, here I lie,Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poisoned.I can no more. The King, the King’s to blame. HAMLETThe point envenomed too! Then, venom, to thywork. [Hurts the King.] ALL Treason, treason! KINGO, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt. HAMLETHere, thou incestuous, murd’rous, damned Dane,Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?[Forcing him to drink the poison.]Follow my mother. [King dies.] LAERTES He is justly served.It is a poison tempered by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee,Nor thine on me. [Dies.] HAMLETHeaven make thee free of it. I follow thee.–I am dead, Horatio.–Wretched queen, adieu.–You that look pale and tremble at this chance,That are but mutes or audience to this act,Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,Is strict in his arrest), O, I could tell you–But let it be.–Horatio, I am dead.Thou livest; report me and my cause arightTo the unsatisfied. HORATIO Never believe it.I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.Here’s yet some liquor left. [He picks up the cup.] HAMLET As thou ‘rt a man,Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I’ll ha ‘t.O God, Horatio, what a wounded name,Things standing thus unknown, shall I leave behindme!If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,Absent thee from felicity awhileAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in painTo tell my story.[A march afar off and shot within.]What warlike noise is this? [Enter Osric.] OSRICYoung Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,To th’ ambassadors of England givesThis warlike volley. HAMLET O, I die, Horatio!The potent poison quite o’ercrows my spirit.I cannot live to hear the news from England.But I do prophesy th’ election lightsOn Fortinbras; he has my dying voice.So tell him, with th’ occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited–the rest is silence.O, O, O, O! [Dies.] HORATIONow cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.[March within.]Why does the drum come hither? [Enter Fortinbras with the English Ambassadors withDrum, Colors, and Attendants.] FORTINBRAS Where is this sight? HORATIO What is it you would see?If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search. FORTINBRASThis quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,What feast is toward in thine eternal cellThat thou so many princes at a shotSo bloodily hast struck? AMBASSADOR The sight is dismal,And our affairs from England come too late.The ears are senseless that should give us hearingTo tell him his commandment is fulfilled,That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.Where should we have our thanks? HORATIO Not from hismouth,Had it th’ ability of life to thank you.He never gave commandment for their death.But since, so jump upon this bloody question,You from the Polack wars, and you from England,Are here arrived, give order that these bodiesHigh on a stage be placed to the view,And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing worldHow these things came about. So shall you hearOf carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,And, in this upshot, purposes mistookFall’n on th’ inventors’ heads. All this can ITruly deliver. FORTINBRAS Let us haste to hear itAnd call the noblest to the audience.For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me. HORATIOOf that I shall have also cause to speak,And from his mouth whose voice will draw onmore.But let this same be presently performedEven while men’s minds are wild, lest moremischanceOn plots and errors happen. FORTINBRAS Let four captainsBear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,For he was likely, had he been put on,To have proved most royal; and for his passage,The soldier’s music and the rite of warSpeak loudly for him.Take up the bodies. Such a sight as thisBecomes the field but here shows much amiss.Go, bid the soldiers shoot.[They exit, marching, after the which, a peal ofordnance are shot off.]","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Afar, we stand......","slug":"0","date":"2026-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2026-02-02T03:22:03.849Z","comments":true,"path":"2026/02/01/0/","permalink":"https://ir-trichloride.github.io/2026/02/01/0/","excerpt":"","text":"谏太宗十思疏魏征〔唐〕 臣闻求木之长者，必固其根本；欲流之远者，必浚其泉源；思国之安者，必积其德义。源不深而望流之远，根不固而求木之长，德不厚而思国之理，臣虽下愚，知其不可，而况于明哲乎！人君当神器之重，居域中之大，将崇极天之峻，永保无疆之休。不念居安思危，戒奢以俭，德不处其厚，情不胜其欲，斯亦伐根以求木茂，塞源而欲流长者也。(思国之理 一作：思国之治；塞源而欲流长者也 一作：塞源而欲流长也) 凡百元首，承天景命，莫不殷忧而道著，功成而德衰。有善始者实繁，能克终者盖寡。岂取之易而守之难乎？昔取之而有余，今守之而不足，何也？夫在殷忧，必竭诚以待下；既得志，则纵情以傲物。竭诚则胡越为一体，傲物则骨肉为行路。虽董之以严刑，振之以威怒，终苟免而不怀仁，貌恭而不心服。怨不在大，可畏惟人；载舟覆舟，所宜深慎；奔车朽索，其可忽乎！(凡百 一作：凡昔；胡越 一作：吴越) 君人者，诚能见可欲则思知足以自戒，将有作则思知止以安人，念高危则思谦冲而自牧，惧满溢则思江海下百川，乐盘游则思三驱以为度，忧懈怠则思慎始而敬终，虑壅蔽则思虚心以纳下，想谗邪则思正身以黜恶，恩所加则思无因喜以谬赏，罚所及则思无因怒而滥刑。总此十思，弘兹九德，简能而任之，择善而从之，则智者尽其谋，勇者竭其力，仁者播其惠，信者效其忠。文武争驰，在君无事，可以尽豫游之乐，可以养松乔之寿，鸣琴垂拱，不言而化。何必劳神苦思，代下司职，役聪明之耳目，亏无为之大道哉！(想谗邪 一作：惧谗邪；弘兹 一作：宏兹；在君 一作：君臣)","categories":[],"tags":[]}],"categories":[],"tags":[]}
